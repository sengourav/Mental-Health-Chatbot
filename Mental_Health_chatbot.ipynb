Adoptions from Russia have grown significantly  since the Soviet Union dissolved. In 2001 13 times as  many children were adopted from Russia as in 1992,  when it was declared independent. Guatemala leads  Central and South America in adoptions. Transracial adoption refers to children who are  placed with an adoptive family of another race or  ethnicity. The new families face unique cultural  issues. An estimated 15 percent of the 36,000 adop- tions from foster care in 1998 were transracial or  transcultural. National Adoption Information Clearinghouse  (NAIC) The National Adoption Information Clearinghouse  (NAIC) was established by Congress in 1987 to  provide free information on all aspects of adop- tion. The clearinghouse maintains many search- able databases, including journal articles and books  related to adoption, lists of organizations dealing  with adoption issues, support groups and relevant  conferences and events. The NAIC Web site pro- vides comprehensive information on domestic and  intercountry adoption. See also INFERTILITY. adrenal cortex  The outer layer of the adrenal  gland. The adrenal cortex is the source of several  hormones, including androgens, glucocorticoids  and mineral corticoids. Functions of the adrenal  cortex are controlled by adrenocorticotropic hor- mone (ACTH), a hormone secreted by the pituitary  gland especially under conditions of physiological  and extreme psychological stress. Excessive produc- tion of one or more of the hormones of the adrenal  cortex is known as adrenal-cortical hyperfunction.  Some types of severe depression, including those  that may result in suicide if not treated, show evi- dence of adrenal hyperfunction. Recently, animal studies have shown evidence  that prolonged stress-related adrenal hyperfunc- tion can be associated with cell death in an area of  the brain called the hippocampus, which regulates  adrenal stress response and is essential for recent  memory and learning. There is suggestive evidence  that this process might occur in humans under con- ditions of prolonged severe stress (e.g., torture and  severe depression). adrenal gland  A small organ above the kidney  that secretes several hormones. The medulla and  the cortex are the two important parts of the gland.  The adrenal medulla secretes two hormones, epi- nephrine (or adrenaline) and norepinephrine (or  noradrenaline). The adrenal gland is also known as  suprarenal gland. See also ADRENAL CORTEX. adrenaline A hormone (also known as epineph- rine) secreted by the central, or medullary, portion  of the adrenal gland that produces an increase in  heart rate, a rise in blood pressure and a contrac- tion of abdominal blood vessels. These sympathetic  changes can be reversed by activation of the para- sympathetic system.

The term “adrenergic  blocking agent” (a.b.a.) also applies to drugs that  block action of the neurotransmitters epinephrine  and norepinephrine. A.b.a.s are selective in action  and are classed as alpha a.b.a.s (alpha blockers or  alpha-receptor blocking agents) and beta a.b.a.s (beta  blockers or beta-receptor blocking agents), depending  on which types of adrenergic receptors they affect.  Medications for some mental disorders may involve  both alpha blockers and beta blockers, although the  beta blockers are used primarily for certain forms of  anxieties, such as test taking, performance and public  STRUCTURE OF ADOPTIVE FAMILIES Married couple 67% Unmarried couple 2% Single female 28% Single male 3% adrenergic blocking agents    15 001-476_mentalhealth_a-z.indd   15 9/27/07   12:33:52 PM')"

W e hope that  readers will find this third edition of The Encyclo- pedia of Mental Health helpful while coping with  everyday challenges in healthy ways. According to Healthy People 2010,  published by  the U.S. government, mental health is a state of  successful mental functioning, resulting in pro- ductive activities, fulfilling relationships, and the  ability to adapt to change and cope with adversity.  This blueprint for good health indicates that men- tal health is indispensable to well-being, family  and interpersonal relationships, and one’s contri- bution to society. Much has changed in the world since the sec- ond edition of T h e  E n c y c l o p e d i a  o f  M e n t a l  H e a l t h  appeared in 2001. Many entries in this third edi- tion reflect the current state of our global soci- ety. Our goal while compiling this edition was to  cover many contemporary and disparate concepts,  including those of aging, technological advance- ments, employment, the economy, war, terrorism,  personal security and acts of nature such as hurri- canes and tsunamis that have profound effects on  mental health as well as some new therapies. Older people today have increased health  expectancies, compared with Americans even  10 years ago, according to the National Institute  on Aging. That means that people over the age of  65 have fewer physical, and, with good luck, also  fewer mental health concerns. A major issue for  the aging population is the decline in mental fac- ulties; promising research is ongoing in the areas  of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Research is  essential: In 1900 there were 120,000 Americans  over age 85. Now there are more than 4 million,  and this is the fastest growing age group in the  United States. Federal officials estimate that by the  year 2030 there will be 72 million, meaning that  20 percent of the American population will be over  age 65. Baby boomers are beginning to turn 65. Now  those born between 1946 and 1960 account for 42  percent of U.S. households. These individuals have  come though periods of very rapid social change,  particularly in the last decade. Change, by itself,  whether for good or not, can be a source of stress  and can influence mental health. Technological  changes, for example, continue at an accelerat- ing pace. Instantaneous communication by cell  phones, including those that transmit pictures, and  Internet access are helpful on a daily basis to many  people but a stressful challenge to some others. As people age, the job market changes. Some  people are forced into earlier retirement than they  had planned. Jobs are no longer for life. Mergers and  layoffs have caused job insecurity across the board,  and in many cases older workers are the first to go  and face an insecure future. Working people also  face increasing threats to good mental health due  to fast-moving worldwide advancements in com- munications and technology. Effective adjustment  strategies are necessary. Recognition of the impact  of mental health on the economy is essential. The shifting global economy causes psychologi- cal uncertainties for many. Many workers are laid  off from jobs they have held for many years. Some  INTRODUCTION 0i-viii_mentalhealth_fm.indd   iv 9/27/07   10:24:34 AM'),\n",

It can be  affected by many factors, ranging from exogenous  stresses that are difficult to manage to biologic defects  or organic diseases that impair brain function. Many approaches have been proposed to reduce  the impact of mental health problems. Stress,  whether stemming from life events, chronic strain  or environmental pressures, is associated with bio- logic changes linked to cognitive, emotional and  behavioral dysfunctions. Healthful habits, such as  good nutrition and adequate amounts of exercise  and relaxation techniques, may be useful in help- ing to relieve stress. Because people with low levels  of control over their environment (actual or per- ceived) appear to be at greater risk, interventions  have also been directed at increasing individuals’  resources and coping skills through education and  social support. For those needing more aggressive  attention, medical interventions are available that  include use of psychotherapies, antidepressant  drugs and a variety of other techniques such as bio- feedback and meditation. Developmental delays in childhood and specific  skill disorders have also been linked to learning  and adjustment problems in adolescence and early  adulthood. Early interventions with parents and  children that address prenatal care, parental skills  and remedial help in early school programs may  help prevent developmental problems and their  progression to mental health problems. Mental Health Parity Act  (MHPA) The Mental  Health Parity Act signed into law on September 26,  1996, requires that annual or lifetime dollar lim- its on mental health benefits be no lower than any  such dollar limits for medical and surgical benefits  offered by a group health plan or health insurance  issuer offering coverage in connection with a group  health plan.

It may affect how the  person thinks, behaves and interacts with other  people. The term encompasses many psychiatric  disorders that vary in severity. Since the 1980s research has led to advance- ments in diagnosis and treatment of many men- tal illnesses. Where once mentally ill people were  hospitalized because they were disruptive or feared  to be harmful to themselves or others, today most  people who suffer from a mental illness, including  those disorders that can be extremely debilitating,  such as schizophrenia, can be treated effectively  and lead full lives. Mental illnesses are described and categorized in  the book Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis- orders, 4th ed., published by the American Psychiat- ric Association. Among the most commonly known  psychiatric disorders are depression, manic depres- sion, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, generalized  anxiety disorder, specific phobias, social phobia,  panic disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive  disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disor- ders (such as delusional disorder), substance abuse  and disorders related to substance abuse, delirium,  dementia (including Alzheimer’s disease), eating  disorders, sleep disorders, attention-deficit/hyper- activity disorder, learning disorders, sexual disor- ders, dissociative disorders and personality disorders  (such as borderline personality disorder and antiso- cial personality disorder). Mental illness is not a weakness or defect in  character. Mental illnesses are real illnesses that  require and respond well to treatment.

Many veterans of the war in Iraq,  which began in 2003, suffer from PTSD and are  receiving treatment to overcome their flashbacks,  depression, nightmares, and feelings of constant  vigilance. Along with shared anxieties, many people  have their own private mental health concerns.  Depression hits more than 1 9 million U.S. adults  each year. Of those, 12 million are women. About  one in eight U.S. women will be diagnosed with  depression during her lifetime. Depression is a  leading cause of drug and alcohol use. Drug and  alcohol addictions continue to incur huge costs for  society, such as emergency medical care crime,  corrections, law enforcement, lost productivity,  education, treatment and prevention. Sleep diffi- culties resulted in 45 million prescriptions being  written for sleep medications in 2005. Many peo- ple manage their anxieties by overeating or smok- ing. In the long run, unhealthy ways of coping take  their toll on physical as well as mental health. Research in the area of therapies for many var- ied mental health issues is ongoing. In the last few  years, the professional community has given much  attention to the use of medications known as atyp- ical antidepressants. Many of these new pharma- ceutical tools have been approved and have been  useful for some people. Another area of ongoing research involves  determining a definition of happiness and how  various people interpret happiness. Happiness  can be defined as a lasting state of mind charac- terized by contentment and acceptance as well  as engagement in life’s experiences with peri- o ds  o f  j o yfuln e s s  an d  a p p r e cia ti o n  as  o p p o s e d  t o   immediate pleasures. Happiness is very difficult  to attain without good mental health and matu- rity, but even then it requires conscious attention.  It is attainable through developing the capacity to  see beyond moments of disappointment and hurt,  beyond the mundane experience of living, and  to appreciate life’s beauty, the miracle of human  consciousness and life itself. Depression, anxieties,  addictive behaviors and severe physical pain make  it difficult to attain happiness by interfering with  the ability to see beyond one’s immediate negative  experience.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) causes chil- dren to have recurring fears and worries that they  find difficult to control. They worry about nearly  everything, from school to natural disasters. They  may be irritable, tense and easily tired and may  have trouble concentrating or sleeping. According  to the National Mental Association, children who  have GAD are usually eager to please others and  may be perfectionists. Separation anxiety can affect a child’s ability to  function socially and in school.

This worrying continues even when the individual  realizes that his or her worrying is excessive and  unreasonable. The person may feel a sense of  impending doom at most times and be unable  to relax. Some individuals worry about financial  issues, while others may worry about a partner’s  fidelity or even world problems that the individual  has no control over. Although the types of worries  vary considerably from person to person, the inten- sity of the worrying is extreme and debilitating in  all who have GAD. The worrying is also accompanied by such phys- ical symptoms as fatigue, insomnia, and irritability.  Muscle tension is a somatic symptom that often  appears in individuals with GAD. Other symptoms  that may occur with GAD include: • headaches • difficulty swallowing •  lightheadedness • irritability • excessive sweating • nausea • a frequent need to urinate • feeling out of breath • difficulty concentrating The anxiety and the physical symptoms nega- tively affect the person both at work and at home. Diagnosis is often made by a mental health  professional, usually from extensive interviews on  developmental history, who notes the severe con- cerns of the patient as well as the physical symptoms  that accompany this anxiety. Medical problems such  as hyperthyroidism should be ruled out (from blood  work) before the diagnosis of GAD is made, because  individuals with hyperthyroidism may exhibit many  of the same symptoms that are found with GAD. Treatment Options and Outlook GAD is treated with antianxiety medications, par- ticularly drugs in the benzodiazepine class. Antide- pressants are also sometimes used to treat anxiety  disorders, such as selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitors (SSRIs). In addition, bupropion (Well- butrin), a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, is used to  treat GAD. cognitive behavioral therapy is often  helpful to teach the patient to adopt more realis- tic and favorable ideas about life and its risks and  challenges. The cognitive behavioral therapies are  usually combined with medications. Here the cli- ent is encouraged to identify irrational cognitions  that produce anxiety and worry. Working with the  therapist, the client is encouraged and coached in  bringing in new, more realistic and rational self- statements that do not lead to worry and anxiety  and help him or her function better with minimal  arousal. Risk Factors and Preventive Measures Women have about twice the risk of developing  GAD as do men, according to the National Institute  of Mental Health. Individuals with a family history  of anxiety disorders, particularly GAD, have an  increased risk for this disorder. Early shyness and  perfectionism are risk factors for developing GAD.  Also, excessive worry and feelings of guilt and  responsibility contribute greatly. See also antianxiety medication; therapy, types  of. Beck, Aaron T., M.D., and Gary Emery.

Following exposure to traumatic stressors, post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops in  only a small subset of people.

Each  disorder is defined by a particular set of symptoms  or problems of behavior. It is important to remem- ber that clinical levels of these symptoms are at  the extremes of frequency or intensity, and they  involve some degree of limitation or restriction of  behavior. Panic Disorder Panic disorder affects about 2.4 million adults in  the United States and is characterized by panic  attacks. Panic attacks are usually described as a  sudden terror response with exaggerated heart- beat, difficulty breathing, dizziness, disorientation  and dissociation , weakness and feelings of help- lessness, and tingling. The individual may have  a fear of losing control and/or of having a heart  attack, a brain stroke, “going crazy,” or dying.  The individual usually wants to run or escape to  a safe place during these attacks. One panic attack  by itself does not constitute a diagnosis of panic  disorder. Several panic attacks within a brief  period of time (usually two weeks) are necessary  before a diagnosis of panic disorder is offered.  Medications such as benzodiazepines  may help as  may cognitive-behavioral therapy and exposure  therapy. Women are about twice as likely to suffer from  panic disorder as males. There is an inherited ten- dency toward panic disorder, and if a first-degree  relative has panic disorder, others in the family  have an eight times greater risk of developing it.  Patients with some syndromes, such as irritable  bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and chronic  fatigue syndrome, have higher rates of panic dis- order than others. There are no known preventive  measures for panic disorder. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)  experience persistent worried thoughts, anxiety,  and often develop rituals to undo or diminish this  anxiety. Obsessions may revolve around contamina- tion, sexual ideas, religious preoccupations, medical  worries or diseases, or thoughts of harming oneself  or others. These thoughts or images are persistent,  worrisome, and unwelcome. Compulsions are rituals  patients feel compelled to act out in order to reduce  or eliminate their anxiety. A combination of medi- cation, response prevention, and exposure therapy  can be used to treat OCD. The disorder may begin  in childhood and occurs at similar rates in men and  women. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major  life-altering disorder that occurs after a person has  experienced a traumatic event. PTSD is a debilitat- ing condition that affects an estimated 5.2 million  adults in the United States, most of them women.  It develops in some people after a terrifying event  but can even fully develop years afterward. The core symptoms of PTSD are intrusive  thoughts, avoidance, and hyperarousal. The most  well known intrusions are flashbacks, making  the survivor relive the traumatic experience, plac- ing him or her back in the past. depression and  anxiety are common side effects of the debilitation  caused by the symptoms of PTSD. Unfortunately,  depression and anxiety responses can disguise the  underlying traumatic roots to these reactions. PTSD was thought to be untreatable until thera- pists began to focus on treatment using bodily  responses, exposure, and modifying catastrophic  cognitions. These therapies seem to speed recovery  and restoration. Medications are also used, but  seem to work best when combined with active  behavioral therapy. natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tor- nados, or hurricanes, usually result in an overall  increase in PTSD, but human-against-human inci- dents (rape, assault, physical and sexual abuse, ter- rorism, medical procedures, robberies, kidnappings,'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/data/The Encyclopedia of Mental Health (Facts on File Library of Health and Living) - PDF Room.pdf', 'page': 337}, page_content='palpitations or rapid heartbeat; sweating; trem- bling or shaking; feelings of smothering or choking;  chest pains, nausea or abdominal distress; dizziness  or light-headedness; paresthesia and chills or hot  flashes.

Individuals  may feel shaky, experience trembling or twitching,  have muscle aches and soreness and become tired  easily. The age of onset for GAD is usually is between  age 20 and 40, and women are twice as likely to be  afflicted than men, according to the Anxiety Disor- ders Association of America.

For some, the anxiety is  nearly always relieved somewhat in the presence of  a trusted companion, a pet or an inanimate object  such as an umbrella or shopping cart. Some agoraphobics develop ways to live more  comfortably with their disorder. For example, those  who go to churches or movie theaters may be less  frightened in an aisle seat so that they can make a  fast exit if they experience a panic attack. Having a  telephone nearby is another comfort. Many agoraphobics have episodes of depres- sion. The first episode may occur within weeks or  months of the first panic attack.

According to the Anxiety Disorders Association of  America, people with an anxiety disorder are three  to five times more likely to go to the doctor and six  times more likely to be hospitalized for psychiat- ric disorders than nonsufferers. While a specific or  single phobia is the most common anxiety disorder,  panic disorder is the most common among people  seeking treatment. Historically, terminology related to anxiety dis- orders has changed over the years. For example,  anxiety disorder was once termed anxiety neurosis  but is no longer referred to in that way. Also, anxi- ety hysteria was once used to refer to what is now  generally called phobia or somatoform disorder. Causes of Anxiety Disorders There are several broad theories regarding causes  of anxiety disorders. However, because anxiety dis- orders are such an individual matter, causes cannot  be generalized. For most individuals, it is no single  condition or situation that causes anxiety disorders  but rather a combination of physical and environ- mental factors linked together. Theories include the psychoanalytic approach,  the learning approach and the biological approach.  Some individual causes may be traced to one of  more of these theories. For example, a person may  develop or inherit a biological susceptibility to anxi- ety disorders, and events in childhood may teach a  person certain fears, which then develop over time  into an anxiety disorder that can be diagnosed. The psychoanalytic theory holds that anxiety  comes from an unconscious conflict in the individ- ual’s past, even during infancy or childhood. Sig- mund Freud suggested that individuals may carry  unconscious childhood conflicts regarding sexual  desire for the parent of the opposite sex. Also, a  person may have developed conflicts because of a  scare, illness or other emotionally charged event  during childhood. Proponents of this theory believe  that anxiety can be resolved when the unconscious  conflict is identified and resolved. Learning theory holds that anxiety is a learned  behavior that can be unlearned. People who are  fearful of certain situations or certain events will try  to avoid them. However, by persistently confronting  the feared situation or object, a person can relearn  responses and relieve anxiety. Behavior therapy is  largely based on learning theory and has helped  many people overcome their anxiety disorders. Biochemical theory says that biochemical changes  occur as a result of emotional, psychological or behav- ioral changes. Proponents of this theory believe that  biochemical imbalances may be responsible for some  anxiety disorders. According to this theory, medical  treatment of biochemical imbalances in the central  nervous system may relieve symptoms of anxiety. Some anxiety disorders seem to run in families.  According to the American Psychiatric Association,  panic disorder, phobias, and obsessive- compulsive  disorder seem to be more common among first- degree biologic relatives of people with each of these  disorders than among the general population. In all categories, women outnumber men except  for obsessive-compulsive disorder and social pho- bia, in which both sexes have an equal likelihood of  being affected, according to the National Institute  of Mental Health. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is likely to be  comorbid (occur along with) with other disorders.  Characteristics include a constant feeling of being  nervous and on edge without any apparent rea- son. There may be unrealistic or excessive anxiety  and worry (apprehensive expectation) about two  or more life circumstances—for example, worry  about finances without good reason or worry about  possible misfortune to one’s spouse (who is in no  danger) for six months or longer—during which')]\n",

Children with ADHD have  impaired functioning in many settings, such  as at home, at school and in relationships with  peers. There is a pattern of inattention and/or   hyperactivity-impulsivity that appears more fre- quently and severely than is usually observed in  individuals at comparable developmental levels. According to NIMH, symptoms of ADHD appear  over the course of many months, including impul- siveness (the child acts quickly without thinking  first), hyperactivity (the child cannot sit still, talks  when others are talking, walks, runs or climbs  around when others are seated) and inatten- tion (the child may daydream or seem to be side- tracked by what is going on around him or her).  To diagnose ADHD, according to the Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., some   hyperactive-impulsive or inattentive symptoms  that cause impairment must have been present  before age seven, although many individuals are  diagnosed after symptoms have been present for  many years. Additionally, there must be evidence  of interference with developmentally appropri- ate social, academic or occupational functioning,  and the disorder cannot be better accounted for by  another mental disorder, such as an anxiety disor- der, dissociative disorder or personality disorder. Usually ADHD is noticed before age five. ADHD  sufferers are often overactive, impulsive and eas- ily distractible. When young people are not treated  in childhood, they may develop negative attitudes  toward school and patterns of failure, which can  be avoided with early diagnosis and intervention.  Even with treatment, some develop behavioral and  substance abuse problems in later life. ADHD may affect 3 to 5 percent of the school age  population, or an estimated two million American  children. It is more common in boys. Generally boys  who have ADHD outnumber girls with the disorder  by about three to one. Data on prevalence in adoles- cence and adulthood are limited. Although there is  extensive literature on which approaches to manage- ment of individual cases are based, no one definition  or approach to treatment is universally accepted. There is public and professional controversy  regarding diagnosis and management of ADHD. The  definition of ADHD, according to the Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual, emphasizes the attention deficit as  the central feature and other symptoms to a vari- able extent. It also recognizes that ADHD exists as a  separate entity from conduct disorder. The essential  feature of conduct disorder is a persistent conduct  pattern in which rights of others and age- appropriate  societal norms or rules are violated. While the two  conditions often occur in the same individual, one  should not assume that one necessarily goes with  the other. Mental health professionals generally  agree that individualized management, on a case by  case method, is most effective. How ADHD is diagnosed. Some parents report  that their child was hyperactive very early, even  from one to two years of age. In those with a later  onset, the disorder is more likely to be associated  with social disruption or specific difficulties at  school. However, many parents do not seek medi- cal attention until the child is in first or second  grade and presents difficulties. Diagnosis is based on a description of the child’s  behavior obtained from parents and teachers, as  well as observation of behavior in the doctor’s office.  Questions for the child are directed toward aspects  of hyperactivity, impulsiveness and lack of atten- tion. Such children are often restless, particularly  while the health professional talks with parents. Psychological tests are sometimes useful to deter- mine whether the child has an associated disorder,  such as a learning disorder or mild mental retarda- tion.

Children who have ADHD usually have  at least one close relative who also has ADHD. At  least one-third of all fathers who had ADHD in  their youth have children with ADHD. When one  twin of an identical twin pair has the disorder, the  other is likely to have it also. Brain imaging research using the techniques  called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has  shown that there are differences between the  brains of children who have and those who do  not have ADHD. Also, there appears to be a link  between a person’s ability to pay attention and the  use of glucose in the brain. In adults with ADHD,  the brain areas that control attention use less glu- cose and appear to be less active, suggesting that  154    developmental disorders 001-476_mentalhealth_a-z.indd   154 9/27/07   12:34:15 PM'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/data/The Encyclopedia of Mental Health (Facts on File Library of Health and Living) - PDF Room.pdf', 'page': 161}, page_content='such as a learning disorder or mild mental retarda- tion. Biochemical studies have shown statistically  significant differences in catecholamine excretion  and peptide-containing urinary complexes. How- ever, while these findings represent a promising  field for further study, they have not reached diag- nostic significance. How ADHD is treated. Individual manage- ment, on a case-by-case basis, is most effective. No  one approach to treatment is universally accepted.  Successful treatment depends on combinations of  therapies involving parents, teachers and mental  health professionals. Usually therapy begins with the health professional  explaining the nature of ADHD, trying to reduce feel- ings of guilt and blame in the family and at the same  time improve the child’s self-esteem. When there are  disorders of family dynamics or a learning disorder  underlying the symptoms, these must be addressed.  Often other health and educational professionals,  developmental disorders    153 001-476_mentalhealth_a-z.indd   153 9/27/07   12:34:15 PM'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/data/The Encyclopedia of Mental Health (Facts on File Library of Health and Living) - PDF Room.pdf', 'page': 162}, page_content='such as psychologists, special education specialists  or social workers become involved in treatment. General advice in counseling families with an  ADHD child usually focuses on behavior manage- ment and avoiding confrontation with the active,  restless child. Such a child should be encouraged to  channel energy into productive activities, such as  stacking books or erasing the blackboard. Behavior modification and cognitive therapy are  used in some cases of ADHD. Treatment strategies  such as rewarding positive behavior changes and  communicating clear expectations of those with  ADHD have also proved effective, according to  the National Association of Mental Illnesses. Chil- dren with ADHD can benefit from caregivers pay- ing close attention to progress and, when possible,  adapting classroom environments to accommodate  individual needs. Other approaches include dietary restrictions of  food additives or refined sugar (Feingold diet); sup- plementation with megavitamins, trace elements  or amino acids and compensating for vestibular  dysfunction. However, the best results have been  noted with a combination of therapies, including  behavior management, special educational inter- vention, and in some cases, the use of stimulant  drugs. There is a reluctance to have children on  chronic medication. Stimulants are often abused,  and parents do not want their children on medica- tions. However, several double-blind studies have  supported the use of these medications. Symptoms are treated with stimulant medica- tion in selected patients; while treatment is effec- tive and safe, it is not curative. A widely used  stimulant is methylphenidate (trade name Ritalin).  It is the most commonly prescribed medication for  children in the United States. The drug is effec- tive for three to four hours and is often prescribed  for use in the morning and at noon. Individual- izing dosage is important because high doses may  help hyperactivity but have been found to impair  learning. When the dose is too high, some chil- dren become excessively quiet and indecisive and  cry easily. When symptoms occur only in school,  the medication may be given only on school days.  A child on stimulant medication should be moni- tored and evaluated by the prescribing physician.  Controversy continues regarding use of medica- tion for this disorder. According to the NAMI,  medication has proved effective in the short-term  treatment of more than 76 percent of individuals  with ADHD. Other commonly used stimulants are dextroam- phetamine (Dexedrine, Desoxyn), amphetamine  and dextroamphetamine (Adderall) and permoline  (Cylert). These drugs increase activity in parts of  the brain that are underactive in those who have  ADHD, improving attention and reducing impul- sivity, hyperactivity and aggressive behavior. Antidepressants, major tranquilizers and anti- hypertensive clonidine (Catapres) have also been  helpful in some cases. The nonstimulant medi- cation Atomoxetine (trade name Strattera) is  a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor  has recently been approved for the treatment of  ADHD. Wellbutrin (buproprion) also has been  approved for this use and found helpful in some  cases. Individuals react differently to treatment. Com- mon side effects of some of these medications  include weight loss, decreased appetite, difficulty  sleeping, and temporary slowing of growth. These  reactions may be controlled by a careful monitoring  of dosages of the medications. Successful outcomes  of therapy usually depend on many types of treat- ments involving mental health professionals, par- ents and teachers. Research findings.

It is prescribed for nar- colepsy (a rare condition characterized by excessive  sleepiness) and also in some cases to treat children  with hyperactivity. It is no longer recommended  as an appetite suppressant for people who want to  lose weight. Dextroamphetamine is one of a group of drugs  commonly known on the street as “uppers.” How- ever, some individuals may actually feel sedated  when taking a test dose of dextroamphetamine.  When the drug is used on a prolonged basis, its  stimulant effects lessen and a higher dose must be  taken to produce the desired effect. Seizures and  high blood pressure may result from overdoses.

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis- orders, Fourth Edition  Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) a standard clas- sification of mental disorders used by mental health  professionals in the United States. Published by the  American Psychiatric Association, it is intended to  apply to a wide array of contexts and is used by cli- nicians and researchers in many disciplines related  to mental health, including biological, psychody- namic cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal and fam- ily systems. It contains diagnostic codes that can be  used to satisfy the requirements of record keeping  and reimbursement. The fourth edition, published in 1994, was the  last major revision of the DSM. It was the product  of a six-year effort involving more than 2,000 indi- viduals and many professional organizations. Much  of the effort involved conducting a comprehensive  review of the literature to establish a firm basis for  making changes. Many changes were made to clas- sifications, and some disorders were added, deleted  or reorganized. Mental health disorders are grouped into 16  major diagnostic classes, such as anxiety disorders  and mood disorders. It was organized to be used in  many settings, including outpatient, inpatient, par- tial hospital consultation-liaison, clinic, private prac- tice and primary care with community populations. The DSM-IV includes an outline to assist clini- cians in evaluating the reporting influences of the  culture on patients in a diverse population. There  is discussion of culture-bound syndromes and cul- tural variations in the clinical presentations of cer- tain disorders. The next major revision of the DSM (DSS-V) will  appear in 2011 or later, according to the American  Psychiatric Association. However, a text revision of  the DSM-IV known as DSM-IV-TR was published in  May 2000. The primary goal of the DSM-IV-TR was to  maintain the integrity of the DSM-IV while changing  some of the descriptive text to correct errors identi- fied in DSM-IV. Some of the diagnostic codes were  changes to reflect updates to the ICD-9-CM coding  system adopted by the U.S. government. The first edition of the book appeared in 1952.  The early categories were voted on by members of  the American Psychiatric Association. The recent  edition was revised over a period of nearly seven  years and prepared by teams of physicians and  researchers, including those from The National  Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), National Insti- tute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the National Insti- tute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA).  Categories were formed by empirical studies.

Individuals may abuse methamphetamine to gain  an illegal high; they may also abuse the drug to  deal with stress or past traumatic events. Methamphetamine is rarely legally used to treat  ADHD, and most methamphetamine is produced  illegally in clandestine laboratories and then sold  illicitly. Methamphetamine has been associated  with all forms of child abuse as well as with sexual  assaults and other violent acts. It can also cause  rapid aging and an extreme and unhealthy weight  loss. Abuse may also lead to seizures and hyper- thermia (extremely high body temperature). It also  heightens sexual arousal and the frequency of sex. Federal laws in the United States limit the  amount of specific precursor chemicals that are  used to make methamphetamine, such as ephed- rine and pseudoephedrine, which can be pur- chased by individuals. Such laws were created to  attempt to limit the private production of illicit  methamphetamine. Withdrawal from Amphetamines The withdrawal from amphetamine should occur  in a treatment center that is experienced with  amphetamine treatment. Withdrawal may take  from six to 18 weeks. The withdrawal is usually  quite severe and traumatizing to the individual  with such symptoms as moderate to severe depres- sion, anxiety, fear, irritability, exhaustion, and  increased sleep as well as an intense craving for  the drug.

As part of the limbic system, the  amygdala is the center for basic emotions, primar- ily fear, aggression, and sexual responses and is  connected to the frontal cortex for visual, auditory,  and sensory inputs. The amygdala can signal the  body to full alertness in times of perceived danger  as it puts emotional meaning to incoming stimuli  from the environment, such as the sound of an  explosion. The amygdala is also involved in both  conscious and subconscious emotional memory. In a study of patients with posttraumatic stress  disorder (PTSD), experiences of their trauma were  written in detailed narratives and then read back  to the patients. This reading triggered flashbacks  and marked autonomic responses. Positron emis- sion tomography (PET) scans of the patients’ brains  showed heightened activity in the right hemi- sphere, the parts of the limbic system connected to  the amygdala, and the amygdala itself. The amyg- dala appears to be at the center of the brain associ- ated with traumatic emotional memory.

Social workers across the country were called upon  to volunteer services to counsel survivors in coping  with feelings of loss, grief, suicidal intentions, depres- sion, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Hyperactive children have unlimited energy and  short attention spans, are prone to temper tantrums  and seem to require little sleep. The condition is  more common in male children. Until their disor- der is understood, many are considered unman- ageable or troublemakers by teachers and parents.  There is a difference of opinion regarding causes  of hyperactivity. Some physicians say hyperactive  behavior may be due to minimal brain damage that  cannot be detected by any diagnostic tests or due to  birth trauma. Others attribute hyperactivity to food  allergies. Diagnosis requires careful evaluation and  is usually made before the child is seven years old;  children so diagnosed exhibit at least six months of  disruptive behavior. Some physicians prescribe a stimulant medica- tion called Ritalin (methylphenidate hydrochlo- ride) or Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine sulfate)  for hyperactivity, which makes hyperactive chil- dren more manageable and able to concentrate  better. The drugs may work by diminishing the  brain’s excess of natural stimulants and replacing  them with milder, synthetic ones. Stimulant medi- cations should be used cautiously because they can  be addictive in young adults. Therapy may include psychotherapeutic coun- seling, meeting with parents and teachers and  participating in support groups for parents and  children. Coping with a hyperactive child requires  a great degree of understanding and patience. Hyperactivity in children is also known as   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). See also DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS. hypersomnia Excessive daytime sleepiness and  an inability to wake up quickly. This can be seen in  one form of depression, which also may manifest  in increased eating and weight gain, as opposed to  another form associated with insomnia, weight loss  and agitation-anxiety. Patients with sleep apnea  syndrome or narcolepsy may also show excessive  daytime sleepiness. See also DEPRESSION; NARCOLEPSY; SLEEP. hypertension See HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. hyperthyroidism Overactivity of the thyroid  gland, which causes an increase of all chemical  reactions within the body, affecting mental as well  as physical processes. It is more common in women  than men. Because some of the symptoms of hyperthyroid- ism seem similar to those of anxiety and depression,  an evaluation by a physician is essential to make a  careful diagnosis. Normally, thyroid gland activity is controlled by  a hormone produced in the pituitary gland. Even  when normal levels of hormone are produced, the  thyroid gland itself continuously produces quanti- ties of its own hormone, thyroxin. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include anxi- ety, tiredness with an inability to sleep, shakiness,  trembling and insensitivity to cold and perspiration  when others are comfortable. There may be irreg- ular and fast heartbeat, palpitations, a fluttering  feeling in the chest and breathlessness after mild  exertion. Individuals who have hyperthyroidism may eat  more and lose weight, muscles may waste away,  and women may have absent or scant menstrual  periods. The thyroid gland in the neck may enlarge  (goiter). In severe cases, eyes may look wide open  and protrude, leading to blurred or double vision.

Two drugs given for differ- ent purposes may have additive side effects, such as  taking a tricyclic antidepressant from one doctor and  an antihistamine drug for allergies from another.  Both have additive anticholinergic side effects. See also ACETYLCHOLINE. ADHD See DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS. adjustment disorders  Clinically significant emo- tional or behavioral symptoms in response to an  identifiable psychosocial stressor or stressors. The  stressor may be a single event, such as ending a  romantic relationship, or multiple stressors, such  as marked business problems as well as marital  problems. Symptoms develop within three months  after the onset of the stressor or stressors. The sig- nificance of the reaction is in excess of what would  be expected given the nature of the stressor, or by  significant impairment in social, occupation or aca- demic functioning. Stressors may be recurrent, such as seasonal  business crises, or continuous, such as living in a  crime-ridden area. Stressors may affect one indi- vidual, an entire family, or a larger community, in  the case of a natural disaster. The American Psychiatric Association character- izes adjustment disorders according to the predomi- nant symptoms: Adjustment disorder with depressed mood Adjustment disorder with anxiety Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and  depressed mood Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct Adjustment disorder with disturbance of emotions  and conduct Adjustment disorder: unspecified Symptoms of adjustment disorder may be either  acute or chronic. If symptoms of adjustment disor- ders last more than six months, they may meet the  criteria for other disorders, such as major depres- sion, dysthymia or generalized anxiety disorder.

Adler, Alfred (1870–1937) An Austrian psychia- trist and the first disciple of Sigmund Freud to  break away and form his own school. Known as  individual psychology, Adler’s theory is based on  the idea that human beings are governed by a con- scious drive to express and fulfill themselves. It also  included concepts such as striving for superiority,  feelings of inferiority, the inferiority complex, com- pensation and overcompensation and the creative  development of an individual style incorporating  both personal and social goals.

Adoption is a lifetime  commitment with lifelong challenges and rewards.  Many states offer or even require training sessions to  help prospective adoptive families learn about adop- tion and prepare for the needs of their adoptive chil- dren. There are many options regarding adoptions,  including public, private or international adoption.  Each type of adoption has different requirements,  but some issues are common to all types. 12    additive effect 001-476_mentalhealth_a-z.indd   12 9/27/07   12:33:52 PM')]\n",

      "AI: As a professional mental health counselor, I can provide information on the common symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety can manifest in various physical and psychological symptoms, including nervousness, muscle tension, inability to sleep, increased sweating, headache, dizziness, irritability, restlessness, and feelings of impending doom. It can also lead to symptoms such as fatigue, stomach pain, trembling, and difficulty concentrating. It's important to note that anxiety symptoms can vary from person to person, and seeking professional help is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n",

       "'ADHD, or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, is one of the most common mental disorders that develop in children. Children with ADHD have impaired functioning in various settings, such as at home, school, and in relationships with peers. The condition is characterized by a pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that is more frequent and severe than what is typically observed in individuals at comparable developmental levels. Symptoms of ADHD include impulsiveness, hyperactivity, and inattention, which can impact social, academic, and occupational functioning. Diagnosis usually occurs before age seven, with evidence of interference with developmentally appropriate functioning. Early diagnosis and intervention are important to prevent negative attitudes towards school and behavioral issues in later life. Treatment approaches for ADHD may include behavior management, cognitive therapy, medication, and educational interventions.'"

Anxious individuals focus on a situation, object  or activity that they want to avoid; extreme anxiet- ies and fears of these experiences can become pho- bias. If the anxiety seems unfocused, it is known  as free-floating anxiety. This is a fear of social criti- cism, diagnosed as a social phobia if it interferes  with normal social or occupational function. Other  phobias may be more specific, such as fear of public  speaking, riding in cars, snakes or mice. Those who suffer from agoraphobia often experi- ence panic attacks first. Recent studies have shown  that about 25 percent of patients with major depres- sion suffer panic attacks. The suicide-attempt rate in  patients with panic attacks has been found to be just  as high as in those with depressive disorders. Anxieties may be experienced in specific peri- ods of sudden onset and be accompanied by physi- cal symptoms such as nausea or dizziness. Anxiety  focused on physical symptoms that preoccupy indi- viduals to the point that they believe they have a  disease can lead to hypochondriasis. Many people turn to smoking, alcohol or drug  use to cope with anxieties. These habits are not  considered healthy coping mechanisms, as they can  lead to health hazards and dependencies. Physi- cians may prescribe antianxiety drugs, or anxiolytic  drugs, for some individuals who experience tempo- rary anxieties at certain times.

Symptoms of  anxiety disorders are different from normal feelings  of nervousness; they may occur for no apparent  reason. People who experience anxiety disorders  usually are apprehensive, are frequent worriers,  and anticipate something unfortunate happen- ing to themselves or others. Characteristics may  include “edginess,” irritability, easy distractibility,  and impatience. Some sufferers have a feeling of  impending death or a desire to run and hide. Anxi- ety disorders interfere with family life and work and  disrupt quality of life because behaviors may lead  people to avoid situations of which they are fearful  or that worsen their anxiety. However, these disor- ders usually respond well to treatment. Anxiety disorders encompass several types of  mental health disorders including \\x81 generalized anxiety disorder \\x81 single and social phobias \\x81 agoraphobia \\x81 panic disorder with or without agoraphobia \\x81 obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) \\x81 post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Physical symptoms Physical symptoms of anxiety disorders may be so  severe that some people are convinced they have  serious medical problems.

For some, the anxiety is  nearly always relieved somewhat in the presence of  a trusted companion, a pet or an inanimate object  such as an umbrella or shopping cart. Some agoraphobics develop ways to live more  comfortably with their disorder. For example, those  who go to churches or movie theaters may be less  frightened in an aisle seat so that they can make a  fast exit if they experience a panic attack. Having a  telephone nearby is another comfort. Many agoraphobics have episodes of depres- sion. The first episode may occur within weeks or  months of the first panic attack. Individuals com- plain of feeling “blue,” have crying spells, feel hope- less and irritable, suffer from a lack of interest in  work and have difficulty in sleeping.

According to the Anxiety Disorders Association of  America, people with an anxiety disorder are three  to five times more likely to go to the doctor and six  times more likely to be hospitalized for psychiat- ric disorders than nonsufferers. While a specific or  single phobia is the most common anxiety disorder,  panic disorder is the most common among people  seeking treatment. Historically, terminology related to anxiety dis- orders has changed over the years. For example,  anxiety disorder was once termed anxiety neurosis  but is no longer referred to in that way. Also, anxi- ety hysteria was once used to refer to what is now  generally called phobia or somatoform disorder. Causes of Anxiety Disorders There are several broad theories regarding causes  of anxiety disorders. However, because anxiety dis- orders are such an individual matter, causes cannot  be generalized. For most individuals, it is no single  condition or situation that causes anxiety disorders  but rather a combination of physical and environ- mental factors linked together. Theories include the psychoanalytic approach,  the learning approach and the biological approach.  Some individual causes may be traced to one of  more of these theories. For example, a person may  develop or inherit a biological susceptibility to anxi- ety disorders, and events in childhood may teach a  person certain fears, which then develop over time  into an anxiety disorder that can be diagnosed. The psychoanalytic theory holds that anxiety  comes from an unconscious conflict in the individ- ual’s past, even during infancy or childhood. Sig- mund Freud suggested that individuals may carry  unconscious childhood conflicts regarding sexual  desire for the parent of the opposite sex. Also, a  person may have developed conflicts because of a  scare, illness or other emotionally charged event  during childhood. Proponents of this theory believe  that anxiety can be resolved when the unconscious  conflict is identified and resolved. Learning theory holds that anxiety is a learned  behavior that can be unlearned. People who are  fearful of certain situations or certain events will try  to avoid them. However, by persistently confronting  the feared situation or object, a person can relearn  responses and relieve anxiety. Behavior therapy is  largely based on learning theory and has helped  many people overcome their anxiety disorders. Biochemical theory says that biochemical changes  occur as a result of emotional, psychological or behav- ioral changes. Proponents of this theory believe that  biochemical imbalances may be responsible for some  anxiety disorders. According to this theory, medical  treatment of biochemical imbalances in the central  nervous system may relieve symptoms of anxiety. Some anxiety disorders seem to run in families.  According to the American Psychiatric Association,  panic disorder, phobias, and obsessive- compulsive  disorder seem to be more common among first- degree biologic relatives of people with each of these  disorders than among the general population. In all categories, women outnumber men except  for obsessive-compulsive disorder and social pho- bia, in which both sexes have an equal likelihood of  being affected, according to the National Institute  of Mental Health. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is likely to be  comorbid (occur along with) with other disorders.  Characteristics include a constant feeling of being  nervous and on edge without any apparent rea- son. There may be unrealistic or excessive anxiety  and worry (apprehensive expectation) about two  or more life circumstances—for example, worry  about finances without good reason or worry about  possible misfortune to one’s spouse (who is in no  danger) for six months or longer—during which')]\n",

      "Human: What is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?\n",
      "AI: As a professional health counselor, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing a traumatic event such as military combat, sexual assault, natural disasters, or accidents. Individuals with PTSD may experience symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and emotional numbness related to the traumatic event. PTSD can impact daily functioning, relationships, and overall well-being. Treatment for PTSD often includes therapy, medication, and support from mental health professionals. It's important for individuals with PTSD to seek help and support to manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.\n",
      "Human: What are the benefits of journaling for mental health?\n",
      "AI: As a professional health counselor, journaling can offer several benefits for mental health. Keeping a journal can help individuals improve self-understanding, track progress, and cope with challenging emotions or behaviors. Journaling can serve as a tool for reflection, stress relief, and problem-solving. It can also help individuals process their thoughts and feelings, identify patterns or triggers, and explore solutions to various issues. Additionally, journaling can be a form of self-expression, creativity, and personal growth. Overall, maintaining a journal can support mental health by promoting self-awareness, emotional regulation, and overall well-being.\n",
      "Human: How does social media affect mental health?\n",
      "AI: As a professional health counselor, social media can have both positive and negative impacts on mental health. On the positive side, social media can provide a platform for social connection, support, and community engagement. It can help individuals stay connected with friends and family, access information and resources, and share experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, social media can also have negative effects on mental health. Excessive use of social media can lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. Comparison with others, cyberbullying, and exposure to unrealistic standards can contribute to negative self-esteem and body image issues. Additionally, constant exposure to curated and filtered content can distort reality and create feelings of inadequacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to use social media mindfully and set boundaries to protect your mental health. Limiting screen time, unfollowing accounts that trigger negative feelings, and engaging in offline activities are some strategies to maintain a healthy relationship with social media. Seeking support from mental health professionals can also help in navigating the impact of social media on mental well-being.\n",
      "Human: What is ADHD\n",
      "AI: As a professional health counselor, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common mental disorder that affects children and can persist into adulthood. ADHD is characterized by patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that are more severe than what is typically observed in individuals of the same age. Symptoms of ADHD can include impulsive behavior, hyperactivity, and inattention, which can impact a child's functioning at home, school, and in relationships with peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "ADHD is typically diagnosed based on a combination of symptoms reported by parents and teachers, as well as observations of the child's behavior. It is important to seek a comprehensive evaluation from a trusted diagnostic team to accurately diagnose ADHD. Treatment for ADHD often involves a combination of therapies, including behavioral management, educational interventions, and in some cases, the use of stimulant medications. Early diagnosis and intervention are key in managing ADHD and preventing negative outcomes such as behavioral problems and substance abuse later in life.\n",

As life is a series of progressions  through emotional stages, it is helpful to remem- ber that change and growth always involve some  degree of stress. In a family, several people are try- ing to cope with their own stress and the stress of  others about whom they care. Diet and exercise can help relieve stress. Nor- mal eating of three meals a day reduces effects of  stress for some people. “Crash diets” and “fad diets”  can lead to anxiety, depression and an inability to  maintain a good weight. Well-balanced meals pro- vide a slow release of necessary nutrients through- out the day. For some people, too much caffeine  causes additional stress by bringing on symptoms  of anxiety. Many people find that regular physical workouts  involving running, walking or exercising in a gym,  health club or on exercise equipment at home help  them relieve stress and get ready to effectively face  challenges of the day ahead. Using muscles is a way  to use up some of the fight or flight readiness in  the body. Some people use massage or soothing music as  stress relievers. Sources of relaxation are very indi- vidual matters. What allows one person to relax  may actually cause stress for another. An example  is noise level in the workplace or at home. Each  individual should try to create an environment in  which to work and live that is the least stressful  and concentrate on reaching peak performance and  feeling of well-being. Individuals who have been exposed to sudden  and unexpected events, such as seeing someone  attacked or beaten, seeing a suicide or death or sur- viving a natural disaster (such as an earthquake or  flood), may have a pattern of stress known as post- traumatic stress disorder. Over a period of weeks,  months or even years, the mind and body may  continue to react in many ways. The individual  may have bad dreams, flashbacks and feelings that  the event is recurring. With support from family,  friends and mental health professionals, these indi- viduals can find help. General Adaptation Syndrome Stressors represent significant changes. How one  adjusts to change influences the extent of stress one  feels. Hans Selye used the phrase “general adapta- tion syndrome” to explain how individuals coped  with the stressors in their lives. Individuals experi- ence events in different ways. What results in emo- tional strain and anxiety for one person may not  bring about those reactions in others. Stress affects all aspects of life. Some individuals  find that stress actually raises their energy level and  helps them focus their mind better on their work or  on a sports activity. Some thrive on many kinds of  stressors. People who do are often attracted to high  stress occupations and professions. Learning to Manage Stress “Stressors cannot be eliminated, so our goals  should be to control and manage stress,” says  Elaine Shepp, LCSW, a psychotherapist in pri- vate practice and on the staff at Rush North Shore  Medical Center, Skokie, Illinois. “It is possible to  ‘neutralize’ the toxic effects of unrelenting stress,”  she explains. “People I know who win the battle  against stress put their personal and professional  lives into perspective. They may experience a con- stantly high level of pressure and unrealistic per- formance objectives at work. However, they have  enough moral courage to become somewhat ‘inner  directed.’ They develop their own ideals of conduct  and objectives and test themselves by their own  standards.” “Some report that they have made a  conscious decision not to continue having a ‘non- life life.’ They are able to prioritize their work and  enjoy some diversions.” Professional Help in Coping with Stress There are times when individuals find that their  mental outlook detracts from the energy required  for productive work and effective personal func- tioning. At these times, talking to a friend just is not  enough; fortunately, psychological help is available'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 436}, page_content='If you find yourself feeling totally overwhelmed  by your stressors and decide to get professional  help, how should you choose a psychotherapist?  You may want to talk with a close colleague or  friend who has experienced psychotherapy. How- ever, the issue of confidentiality is just as important  as the need to find a mental health professional  who is nonjudgmental. The psychotherapist should  be one with whom you have a sense of comfort,  who understands your particular stressors and who  can suggest practical ways for you to handle these  stressors. Find a therapist who is multifaceted in his  or her approach to problems and knowledgeable  about the many options available to treat particu- lar problems. Look for one who is open to consult- ing with other professionals who have additional  expertise. Finding Relief from Stress Sources of relaxation are very individual matters.  Many people find that regular physical workouts  help them relieve stress and get ready to effectively  face challenges of the day ahead.

Each  individual should try to create an environment in  which to work and live that is the least stressful and  that allows him or her to concentrate on reaching  peak performance and achieving feelings of well- being. Many complementary therapies are used to  relieve stress; they include acupuncture, biofeed- back, guided imagery, hypnosis, meditation, pro- gressive muscle relaxation and yoga. Also, hobbies  help many people relieve stress. When they par- ticipate in an activity simply for enjoyment, their  stress level goes down; such hobbies may include  dancing, art and painting, sewing, building model  trains or plane, bird watching or playing a musi- cal instrument. Choices of hobbies are as diverse as  human nature. Diet and exercise are basics of wellness and can  also help relieve stress.

In some cases,  interpersonal stresses develop when an individual  has two feelings at the same time, such as wanting  to be an independent adolescent yet feeling depen- 426    stress 001-476_mentalhealth_a-z.indd   426 9/27/07   12:34:59 PM'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 268}, page_content='260 Kabat-Zinn, Jon, Ph.D.  Founder and director of  the Stress Reduction Clinic, University of Massa- chusetts Medical Center, Worcester, where he is  also an associate professor of medicine. He is the author of popular books about mental  health, including Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday  Life (1993) and Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wis- dom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain and Ill- ness (1991). Dr. Kabat-Zinn is a proponent of mindfulness  meditation, a more than 2,000-year-old Buddhist  method of living fully in the present. This approach  offers a unique way to cope with stress and illness  because mindfulness meditation can help induce  deep states of relaxation and, at times, directly  improve physical symptoms. Other forms of meditation involve focusing on a  sound or the sensation of breath leaving and enter- ing the body; anything else that comes up in the  mind during meditation is seen as a distraction to  be disregarded. Mindfulness, on the other hand,  is “insight” meditation. It encourages one to note  any thoughts and observe them nonjudgmentally,  moment by moment, as they occur in one’s aware- ness. This practice of observing thoughts, feelings  and sensations can help one become calmer and  have a broader perspective on one’s life. It involves  a significant commitment to oneself; it is a way of  life. In his writings, Dr. Kabat-Zinn explains how to  live in the moment by taking up such techniques  as “non-doing,” trust and concentration. He shows  readers meditation postures and describes ways to  meditate, including visualizing mountains and lakes  and concentrating on walking or standing. Like many mind/body techniques, mindfulness  has just begun to be explored scientifically. Typi- cally, the training program for mindfulness medi- tation lasts eight weeks. Controlled studies are  investigating whether mindfulness meditation can  influence the healing process and help in treating  many diseases.

Frank Lawlis, Ph.D., wrote “People [in Japan]  are literally dying at their workstations. It appears  that their entire physiological system collapses or  shuts down.” Lawlis drew from a 1989 study by Chiyoda Fire  and Marine Insurance, Ltd., one of the top insur- ance carriers in Japan. Chiyoda, which covers more  than 100,000 Japanese corporations, conducted a  major study on the health problems Japanese peo- ple are likely to encounter. One important conclu- sion of the study was that stress played a major role  in 40 percent of the health problems. In 1997 Dr. Katsuo Nishiyama of Japan, published  a paper in the International Journal of Health Services   (February 4, 1997) in which he reviewed the history  of karoshi and progress to stop the increase in the  disease. The process of work intensification, he said,  has resulted in night shift work, increased scheduled  and unscheduled overtime and holiday work and  formal and informal functions during off-work time.

With stress, these conditions worsen.  Maddi suggests mentally reviewing where things  are not feeling just right physically and reviewing  situations that might be stressful. Focusing increas- ing one’s sense of control over stress enables one to  make changes. Reconstructing stressful situations is a technique  in which you think about a recent stressful episode  and write down three ways it might have gone bet- ter and three ways it might have gone worse. If you  cannot think of what you could have done differ- ently, focus on a person you know who deals with  stress well and think about what he or she would  have done. Realize that things did not go as badly as  they could have. Also, realize that you can think of  ways to cope better with the same situation. In the self-improvement technique, you accept  that there are some situations you cannot control  and that you cannot avoid these situations, such as a  serious illness or illness of a member of your family,  but to regain your sense of control and achieve more  effective coping, you choose a new task to master,  such as learning how to swim, or develop a new  hobby, while dealing with the stressful situation. Suzanne Kobasa, a psychologist at the City Uni- versity of New York, also used the term hardiness to  identify and measure a style of psychological cop- ing. Some of the characteristics exhibited by people  with hardiness included viewing life’s demands as  challenges rather than threats, responding with  excitement and energy to change and having a  commitment to something they felt was meaning- ful, such as their work, community or family. A  third trait was a sense of being in control. Having  the right information and being able to make deci- sions can make an important difference in coping  with stress.

The active ingredient is delta–9- tetrahydrocannabinol, which is metabolized in the  liver to a related substance that produces intoxicat- ing effects. Hashish oil is extracted from cannabis  plant materials to produce a dark, viscous liquid  that averages around 20 percent THC. See also MARIJUANA; SUBSTANCE ABUSE.

For many  this has become a satisfying way of life, but for oth- ers it has involved many frustrations, anxieties and,  in some cases, feelings of guilt. Some women feel  that they are not giving adequate attention to the  marriage and children, are constantly tired and  feel some guilt over having their children in day- care centers. Nevertheless, an increasing number  of women opt to enter business and professions.  Those who are most successful say it is because of  the helpfulness and understanding of their spouse.

Better Coping for Better Mental Health When Hans Selye (1907–82), an Austrian-born  Canadian endocrinologist and psychologist, wrote  his landmark book The Stress of Life, he described  the general adaptation syndrome. The secret of  health, he said, was in successful adjustment to  ever-changing conditions. Research studies have shown that people who  cope well with life’s stresses are healthier than those  who have maladaptive coping mechanisms. In his  book, Adaptation to Life, George Vaillant, a Harvard  psychologist, summarized some insights about rela- tionships between good coping skills and health. He  found that individuals who typically handle the tri- als and pressures of life in an immature way also  tend to become ill four times as often as those who  cope well. Stone and Porter reported that coping efforts  may have direct effects upon symptom perception,  as well as indirect effects on physiological changes,  disease processes, mood changes, compliance with  physician’s instructions and physician-patient  communication.

Cortisol is released  in response to stress. Depressed individuals show  consistently increased concentrations of plasma  cortisol. In contrast to normal patients, depressed  patients also do not consistently suppress their  plasma cortisol levels in response to dexametha- sone. Dexamethasone suppresses cortisol secretion  by acting on receptors at the hypothalamopituitary  level to “turn off” adrenocorticotropic hormone  (ACTH) and, in turn, cortisol; in depressed individ- uals this feedback mechanism is deficient.

Cotherapy is also known as combined  therapy, cooperative therapy, dual leadership, mul- tiple therapy and three-cornered therapy. Cother- apists work in various areas. For example, in sex  therapy, one therapist is a male and the other is  female, which encourages both viewpoints in sexu- ality problems affecting a married couple.

Such services may range  from a trained social worker to a psychiatrist. Ser- vices may be provided in a school or employment  setting or in a health center. Counseling may be available for an individual,  a couple or a family. When one is seeking counsel- ing, help can be obtained by calling a local hospital  or looking in the yellow pages of the telephone  directory under psychologists or psychiatrists.  Some listings have the heading “counselors.”  There are also many self-help and support groups  in which members who have similar situations  share experiences. A sense of improvement takes  place for many participants in the group because  they realize that they are not alone with their  problems and concerns.

Individuals with PTSD may experience symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and emotional numbness related to the traumatic event. PTSD can impact daily functioning, relationships, and overall well-being. Treatment for PTSD often includes therapy, medication, and support from mental health professionals. It's important for individuals with PTSD to seek help and support to manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.\n",

      "AI: As a professional health counselor, journaling can offer several benefits for mental health. Keeping a journal can help individuals improve self-understanding, track progress, and cope with challenging emotions or behaviors. Journaling can serve as a tool for reflection, stress relief, and problem-solving. It can also help individuals process their thoughts and feelings, identify patterns or triggers, and explore solutions to various issues. Additionally, journaling can be a form of self-expression, creativity, and personal growth. Overall, maintaining a journal can support mental health by promoting self-awareness, emotional regulation, and overall well-being.\n",

      "AI: As a professional health counselor, social media can have both positive and negative impacts on mental health. On the positive side, social media can provide a platform for social connection, support, and community engagement. It can help individuals stay connected with friends and family, access information and resources, and share experiences.\n",

      "However, social media can also have negative effects on mental health. Excessive use of social media can lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. Comparison with others, cyberbullying, and exposure to unrealistic standards can contribute to negative self-esteem and body image issues. Additionally, constant exposure to curated and filtered content can distort reality and create feelings of inadequacy.\n",

ADHD is characterized by patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that are more severe than what is typically observed in individuals of the same age. Symptoms of ADHD can include impulsive behavior, hyperactivity, and inattention, which can impact a child's functioning at home, school, and in relationships with peers.\n",

      "ADHD is typically diagnosed based on a combination of symptoms reported by parents and teachers, as well as observations of the child's behavior. It is important to seek a comprehensive evaluation from a trusted diagnostic team to accurately diagnose ADHD. Treatment for ADHD often involves a combination of therapies, including behavioral management, educational interventions, and in some cases, the use of stimulant medications. Early diagnosis and intervention are key in managing ADHD and preventing negative outcomes such as behavioral problems and substance abuse later in life.\n",

Depression usually becomes  more prevalent during the winter months, while the  mood switches to mania with the coming of spring. The incidence of SAD rises with geographic lati- tude, affecting 1.4 percent of Floridians but almost  10 percent of the population of New Hampshire. Therapy for SAD includes use of specially made  bright lights that extend the hours of illumination  during short winter days. In some cases, medica- tions and psychotherapy are useful. Role of Genetics People who eat more, sleep more and are more  depressed during the winter months probably have  family members experiencing similar changes,  according to an article in the Archives of General  Psychiatry (January 1996). Researchers from Wash- ington University School of Medicine in St. Louis,  Missouri, surveyed 4,639 adult twins from Australia  to determine if there is a biological predisposition to  seasonal rhythms in mood and behavior (seasonal- ity). Two types of seasonality have been clinically  described: one characterized by a winter pattern and  a second by a summer pattern of depressive mood  disturbance. Other surveys, cited by the research- ers, have shown that one in four adults suffers from  some type of seasonality disorder. Many of the twins surveyed for this study (40  percent) lived in the Australian state of Victoria.  The region has seasonal changes in sunlight expo- sure similar to Montgomery County, Maryland,  where research on SAD was pioneered, according  to the article. The researchers found that winter was much  more likely than summer to lead to changes in  mood, energy, social activity, sleep, appetite and  weight. They also found a “significant genetic influ- ence” on those changes. The researchers wrote:  “Thirteen percent of our sample complained that  seasonality was a personal problem, 17 percent  reported that they felt worse during the winter  and eight percent reported that they experienced a  summer pattern of worsening in mood. Only 2 per- cent of our sample reported a degree of seasonality  that resembled the response of patients who were  clinically diagnosed as having seasonal affective  disorder (SAD),” which is the most extreme form  of seasonality. The researchers concluded that “There is a ten- dency for seasonality to run in families, and this is  largely owing to a biological predisposition.” These  findings support continuing efforts to understand  the role of seasonality in the development of mood  disorders.

F. “Seasonal Changes in Mood and  Behavior.” Archives of General Psychiatry (Janurary 1996). secondary depression  A depression occurring  in an individual who has another illness—either  mental or physical—that precedes the depression.  Depression may accompany psychiatric disorders,  such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, alcohol  abuse or alcoholism (most common), and it may  occur after or along with a medical illness. Careful  evaluation of secondary depression is essential to  determining the cause and course of treatment. See also ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS; DEPRESSION. secondary gain  Advantages derived from an  anxiety disorder, other than the primary gain of  relieving the internal conflict or anxiety. Examples  of such gains include attention, sympathy, avoid- ance of work and domination of others. These gains  are reactions to the illness instead of causal factors.  They often prolong the anxiety disorder and may  create resistance to therapy. secrets The word “secret” is derived from the  Latin word “secretus,” meaning separate, or out of  the way. The current definition, according to the  American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,  includes the following: \\x81 something kept hidden from others or known  only to oneself or to a few \\x81 concealed from general knowledge or view \\x81 dependably close-mouthed; discreet \\x81 not visibly expressed; private; inward secrets    389'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 157}, page_content='\\x81 overreaction to criticism \\x81 extreme fluctuations between boredom and  talkativeness \\x81 sleep disturbances \\x81 anger, rage and verbal sarcasm; guilt \\x81 intensive ambivalence between dependence and  independence \\x81 feelings of emptiness in life \\x81 restlessness and agitation \\x81 pessimism about the future \\x81 refusal to work in school or cooperate in general \\x81 increased or decreased appetite; severe weight  gain or loss \\x81 death wishes, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts Depression in a young person may be somewhat  different from that in an adult because adolescents  do not always understand or express feelings well.  Some of their symptoms may be overlooked as part  of growing up. There is a strong cycle of “getting into  trouble” and feeling depressed. A teenager may be  depressed because of being in trouble, or in trouble  because of being depressed. Depression in adolescents  is sometimes linked to poor school performance, tru- ancy, delinquency, alcohol and drug abuse, disobedi- ence, self-destructive behavior, sexual promiscuity,  rebelliousness, grief and running away. The young  person may have felt a lack of support from family  and other significant people and a decrease in the  ability to cope effectively. In many instances where  depression is attributed to adolescent conflicts, it  turns out that depressive episodes are the beginning  of mood cycles related to recurrent major depression,  bipolar disorders or dysthymia, which require expert  diagnosis and psychiatric treatment. Melancholia Melancholia is a severe form of depression that may  originate without any precipitating factors, such as  stress. This is in contrast to a reactive depression,  which occurs after some stressful life event such as  loss of a job or divorce. Seasonal Mood Disorder  (Seasonal Affective Disorder) Some individuals have mood symptoms related to  changes of season, with depression often occur- ring most frequently during winter months and  improvement in the spring. Many of these indi- viduals experience periods of increased energy,  productivity and even euphoria in the spring and  summer months. Also called seasonal affective dis- order, this type of depression has often been found  responsive to light therapy. Treatments A variety of therapies and medications help peo- ple of all ages who have depression. Estimates are  that between 80 and 90 percent of all depressed  people can be effectively treated. Many types of  therapists provide help. In general, therapists use  “talk” treatment to try to understand the individu- al’s disturbed personal and social relationships that  may have caused or contributed to the depression.  Depression, in turn, may make these relationships  more difficult. A therapist can help an individual  understand his or her illness and the relationship  of depression and particular interpersonal conflicts.  If psychotherapy is not helpful or the depression is  of such a severe level that there is a loss of work,  function or persistent and increasing suicidal ide- ation over one to three months, medications may  be needed to lift the depression in conjunction with  therapy. Psychoanalysis. Treatment of depression with  psychoanalysis is based on the theory that depres- sion results from past conflicts pushed into the  unconscious. Psychoanalysts work to identify and  resolve the individual’s past conflicts that have led  to depression in later years. Short-Term Psychotherapy. In the mid-1980s,  researchers reported effective results of short- term psychotherapy in treating depression. They  noted that cognitive/behavioral therapy and inter- personal therapy were as effective as medications  for some depressed patients. Medications relieved  patients’ symptoms more quickly, but patients  who received psychotherapy instead of medica- tion had as much relief from symptoms after 16  weeks and their gains may last longer.

This therapy  is based on the understanding that people’s emo- tions are controlled by their views and opinions of  the themselves and their world. Depression results  when individuals constantly berate themselves,  expect to fail, make inaccurate assessments of what  others think of them, overvalue situations, cata- strophize and have negative attitudes toward the  world and their futures. Therapists use techniques  of talk therapy to help the individual replace nega- tive beliefs and thought patterns. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT). Use of ECT  to treat depression has declined in the last two  decades as more effective medications have been  developed. However, ECT is still used for some  individuals who cannot take medications because  of their physical conditions or who do not respond  to anti- depressant medication. ECT is considered as  a treatment when all other therapies have failed or  when a person is suicidal.

Chapters throughout  the country meet locally to help members cope  effectively with depression.

However, if detected early enough, lead  poisoning can be treated, Lead encephalopathy  is a brain disorder seen in children who eat lead- containing paint. Symptoms include convulsions,  mania, delirium and coma. (Lead encephalopathy  can also occur in adults who inhale tetraethyl lead  in gasoline fumes.) learned helplessness  A term developed during  the 1970s by Martin Seligman (1942– ) to refer to  a feeling of helplessness and stifling of motivation  caused by exposure to aversive events over which  the individual has no control, sometimes leading to  depression. When individuals believe they have no control  over their situation, they feel powerless and helpless.  Having no ability to gain praise or positive reinforce- ments, they become passive and nonassertive. Under  these circumstances, tendencies toward depression  increase. The situation develops sooner or later in  individuals who experience their efforts having no  positive effect on a negative or painful situation. This researcher said that self-initiated behavior is  learned and that hindrance to initiation contributes  to the helpless feeling the individual develops over  time. However, there is emerging evidence that the  development of learned helplessness or resistance  to this development in experimental animals may  be controlled by a genetic trait and modified by  drugs used to treat depression. See also LEARNED OPTIMISM. learned optimism An attempt to identify habits of  thinking that lead to negative feelings and giving up  (learned helplessness), coined by Martin Seligman  (1942– ) and reverse them so that when under  stress or facing a failure, an individual may persist or  fight back and not “give up.” Examples of such nega- tive beliefs are: (1) If I fail, it is always my fault. (2) If  I fail in one area, I will fail in others. (3) If I fail now,  I will continue to fail. Seligman attempts to show  how reversal of these responses can produce learned  optimism. Seligman expounded on this theory in  his book Helplessness: On Depression, Development, and  Death (San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1975). See also LEARNED HELPLESSNESS. learning disabilities A group of psychological and  neurological disorders that interfere with learning  or make learning impossible. Children with learn- ing disabilities are often taunted by their peers,  which further reduces their sense of self-esteem and  motivation. Learning disorders are generally diffi- cult to diagnose; after diagnosis, children should be  observed and taught by specialists in their educa- tion. Such disabilities include problems in learning  caused by defects in speech, hearing and memory  but do not include disabilities due to emotional or  environmental deprivation or to poor teaching. There are some specific learning disabilities. For  example, dyslexia is difficulty reading; dyscalculia  is an inability to perform mathematical problems;  and dysgraphia refers to writing disorders. Specific  learning difficulties in children of normal intel- ligence may be caused by forms of minimal brain  dysfunction, which may be inherited.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 155}, page_content='Causes There is no single cause for depression. It is related  to many factors, including a family history of  depression, psychosocial stressors, diseases, alco- hol, drugs, gender and age. Depression occurs in  mood disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic dis- orders, adjustment disorders and psychoactive  substance use disorders, including alcoholism. Indi- viduals who have personality disorders, especially  obsessive-compulsive, dependent, avoidant and  borderline personality disorders, are susceptible to  depression. Psychosocial Factors An individual’s lack of confidence in her inter- personal skills and personality traits such as over- dependency on others as a source of support and  self-esteem, perfectionism and unrealistic expecta- tions work together with psychosocial stressors to  cause depression. Such psychosocial events include  death of a spouse, loss of a job and, for some, urban  living. Social Learning Theory Some psychologists say that stress disrupts involve- ment with others, resulting in a reduction in degree  and quality of positive reinforcement. This leads to  more negative self-evaluation and a poor outlook of  the future. Depressed people view themselves and  the world negatively, which leads to a further sense  of low self-worth, feelings of rejection, alienation,  dependency, helplessness and hopelessness. Cognitive Theory Often unrecognized negative attitudes toward the  self, the future and the world result in feelings of  failure, helplessness and depression. These distorted  attitudes may activate a prolonged and deepening  depressive state, especially under stress. Learning  what they are, understanding their negative distor- tions and challenging those hopeless and negative  thoughts in real life can reverse both depression  and a tendency for future depression. Psychoanalytic Theory A psychoanalytic position regarding depression is  that a loss, or a real or perceived withdrawal of  affection, in childhood may be a predeterminant  of depression in later life. Sigmund Freud and  Karl Abraham mentioned the role of ambivalence  toward the lost love object, identification with the  lost object and subsequent anger turned inward. Later theories suggested an unrealistic expec- tation of self and others and loss of self-esteem as  essential components leading to depression. Depres- sion arising after a saddened reaction in experienc- ing loss may result from a failure to work through  the loss. Interpersonal Theory This theory emphasizes the importance of social  connections for effective functioning. An individ- ual develops adaptive responses to the psychosocial  environment during early developmental experi- ences. When early attachment bonds are disrupted  or impaired, the individual may be vulnerable later  on to more interpersonal and social problems that  lead to depression. Genetic Factors Some individuals may be biologically predisposed  to develop depression, based on genetic factors  that researchers do not yet fully understand. There  are genetic markers that indicate susceptibility to  manic-depressive illness, and considerable research  has been under way in the last 25 years toward  understanding the biochemical reactions controlled  by these genes. There is considerable evidence that depression  runs in families. For example, if one identical twin  suffers from depression or manic-depression, the  other twin has a 70 percent chance of also having  the illness. Research studies looking at the rate of  depression among adopted children have supported  this finding. Depressive illnesses among children’s  adoptive family had little effect on their risk for the  disorder; however, among adopted children whose  biologic relatives suffered depression, the disorder  was three times more common than the norm.  Among more severe depressives, family history is  more often a significant factor.

Angina pectoris is not a sharp pain but  rather a sensation of pressure, squeezing or tight- ness. Usually it starts in the center of the chest  under the breastbone (sternum) and radiates to  the throat area. Typically, the pains are along the  inside of the left arm, part of the wrist, a few fin- gers and the shoulder. Symptoms of angina are  usually due to muscle fibers of the heart not get- ting enough blood through the coronary arteries  to nourish them. Chest pains cause some individuals great mental  anguish because they fear that they are having a  heart attack and they also fear hearing a diagnosis  from a physician. However, all chest pains should be  carefully diagnosed by a physician as soon as possi- ble. Most chest pains are not angina but are caused  by emotional tension, strain of the chest muscles,  referred pain from a spinal disk, indigestion, ulcers,  lung problems or other disease not directly related  to the heart. Knowing the source of a chest pain  can reassure an individual and put her mind at rest  concerning the condition of her heart. Typically, an angina symptom appears when a  person exerts himself and disappears when he rests.  Most attacks last for only two or three minutes, but  if they are set off by anger or other emotional ten- sion and the individual cannot relax, they may last  10 minutes or longer. Individuals who have angina pectoris should  become aware of what it is that precedes attacks  and learn to avoid those situations. Typically, such  individuals are advised to reduce fat in their diet,  lose weight, possibly take antianxiety medications  when they feel extremely anxious and stop smok- ing (if they are smokers), as tobacco may provide  an angina attack by speeding up the heartbeat, con- stricting blood vessels and raising blood pressure. Treatment for angina pectoris includes immedi- ate rest and a nitroglycerin tablet dissolved under  the tongue. Some people take this drug as a pre- ventive measure if they are subject to attacks and  are going through a period of unusual stress. Amyl  nitrite is another drug that can be administered by  inhalation. When neither drug is available, a sip of  whisky or brandy may be helpful. See also CHRONIC ILLNESS. angst A feeling of anxiety. Angst is a central con- cept in the existentialist approach to psychology,  which interprets the essence of human existence  by emphasizing basic human values such as self- awareness, love and free will. The word “angst”  is derived from the German term meaning “fear,  anxiety, anguish.” See also ANXIETY; FEAR. anhedonia A diminished capacity to enjoy or  experience pleasure in situations or acts that nor- mally would be pleasurable. Anhedonia is a marker  for classic depression states. Anhedonia, also known  as dystychia, in extreme forms may be a symp- tom of schizophrenia or a depressive disorder. The  word “anhedonia” was coined by Ribot, a French  psychologist, to refer to “an insensibility relat- ing to pleasure alone,” in contrast to “analgesia,”  or the absence of pain. Anhedonia was described  as a schizophrenic symptom by the German psy- chiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856–1926) and the Swiss  psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler (1857–1939), although  both psychopathologists viewed anhedonia as only')]\n",

This therapy  is based on the understanding that people’s emo- tions are controlled by their views and opinions of  the themselves and their world. Depression results  when individuals constantly berate themselves,  expect to fail, make inaccurate assessments of what  others think of them, overvalue situations, cata- strophize and have negative attitudes toward the  world and their futures. Therapists use techniques  of talk therapy to help the individual replace nega- tive beliefs and thought patterns. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT). Use of ECT  to treat depression has declined in the last two  decades as more effective medications have been  developed. However, ECT is still used for some  individuals who cannot take medications because  of their physical conditions or who do not respond  to anti- depressant medication. ECT is considered as  a treatment when all other therapies have failed or  when a person is suicidal.

Some of their symptoms may be overlooked as part  of growing up. There is a strong cycle of “getting into  trouble” and feeling depressed. A teenager may be  depressed because of being in trouble, or in trouble  because of being depressed. Depression in adolescents  is sometimes linked to poor school performance, tru- ancy, delinquency, alcohol and drug abuse, disobedi- ence, self-destructive behavior, sexual promiscuity,  rebelliousness, grief and running away. The young  person may have felt a lack of support from family  and other significant people and a decrease in the  ability to cope effectively. In many instances where  depression is attributed to adolescent conflicts, it  turns out that depressive episodes are the beginning  of mood cycles related to recurrent major depression,  bipolar disorders or dysthymia, which require expert  diagnosis and psychiatric treatment. Melancholia Melancholia is a severe form of depression that may  originate without any precipitating factors, such as  stress. This is in contrast to a reactive depression,  which occurs after some stressful life event such as  loss of a job or divorce. Seasonal Mood Disorder  (Seasonal Affective Disorder) Some individuals have mood symptoms related to  changes of season, with depression often occur- ring most frequently during winter months and  improvement in the spring. Many of these indi- viduals experience periods of increased energy,  productivity and even euphoria in the spring and  summer months. Also called seasonal affective dis- order, this type of depression has often been found  responsive to light therapy. Treatments A variety of therapies and medications help peo- ple of all ages who have depression. Estimates are  that between 80 and 90 percent of all depressed  people can be effectively treated. Many types of  therapists provide help. In general, therapists use  “talk” treatment to try to understand the individu- al’s disturbed personal and social relationships that  may have caused or contributed to the depression.  Depression, in turn, may make these relationships  more difficult. A therapist can help an individual  understand his or her illness and the relationship  of depression and particular interpersonal conflicts.  If psychotherapy is not helpful or the depression is  of such a severe level that there is a loss of work,  function or persistent and increasing suicidal ide- ation over one to three months, medications may  be needed to lift the depression in conjunction with  therapy. Psychoanalysis. Treatment of depression with  psychoanalysis is based on the theory that depres- sion results from past conflicts pushed into the  unconscious. Psychoanalysts work to identify and  resolve the individual’s past conflicts that have led  to depression in later years. Short-Term Psychotherapy. In the mid-1980s,  researchers reported effective results of short- term psychotherapy in treating depression. They  noted that cognitive/behavioral therapy and inter- personal therapy were as effective as medications  for some depressed patients. Medications relieved  patients’ symptoms more quickly, but patients  who received psychotherapy instead of medica- tion had as much relief from symptoms after 16  weeks and their gains may last longer.

Three biochemicals  that are often out of balance in depressed people  are serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. An  imbalance of serotonin may cause the anxiety,  sleep problems and irritability that many depressed  people experience. An inadequate supply of nor- epinephrine, which regulates alertness and arousal,  may contribute to the fatigue, depressed mood  and lack of motivation. Dopamine imbalances may  relate to a loss of sexual interest and an inability  to experience pleasure. Several neurotransmitter  imbalances may be involved, and research is find- ing other neurotransmitters that may be important  in clinical depression. Cortisol Another body chemical that may be out of balance  in depressed people is cortisol, a hormone produced  by the body in response to extreme cold, fear or  anger. In normal people, cortisol levels in the blood  peak in the morning and decrease later in the day.  In depressed people, however, cortisol peaks early  in the morning and does not level off or decrease in  the afternoon or evening. Recent research in ani- mals suggests that abnormal elevations of cortisol  sustained over three months may cause changes in  brain structure. Environmental Inﬂ uences Environment plays an important role, although  researchers view depression as the result of inter- action of environmental as well as biologic factors.  Historically, depression has been viewed as either  internally caused (endogenous depression) or exter- nally related to environmental events (exogenous  or reactive depression). Major changes in one’s  environment (such as a move or job change) or any  major loss (such as a divorce or death of a loved  one) can bring on depression. Feeling depressed in  response to these changes is normal, but when it  becomes a severe long-term condition (over one  month) and interferes with effective functioning, it  requires treatment. Some environmental factors related to depres- sion include being unemployed, elderly and alone,  poor, single and a working mother of young chil- dren. However, depression changes an individual’s  way of looking at ordinary life stresses so as to  exaggerate the negative aspects, leading to feelings  of being hopeless, helpless and overwhelmed. Illness Psychological stressors caused by physiological  dysfunctions can lead to depression. For example,  a debilitating disease can severely restrict usual  lifestyle, resulting in depression. Any illness that  impinges on cerebral functioning and impairs blood  flow to the brain can produce depression. Such ill- nesses may include adrenal cortex, thyroid, and  parathyroid dysfunctions and many neurologi- cal, metabolic and nutritional disorders, as well as  infectious diseases. Medications as a Cause Some medications have been known to cause  depression. For example, during the 1950s, doc- tors learned that some people taking reserpine, a  medication for high blood pressure, suffered from  depression. Since then, depression has been noted  as a side effect of some tranquilizers, hormones and  a number of medications. However, alcohol is more  likely to cause depression than any medication. Adolescent Depression Recognizing depression in oneself or in one’s chil- dren or students is important. Depression is an ill- ness and should be treated as such with available  help. Adolescence is a period of demanding and  complicated conflicts that lead many young people  to develop anxieties, negative self-esteem and fears  about their future. Some develop depression when  overwhelmed by peer pressure, feelings of loneli- ness, powerlessness and isolation. Low performance  in school can also lead to a feeling of rejection. The lack of ability to embrace what life has to  offer often results in boredom, which may be an  indicator of vulnerability to depression. Contributing factors to adolescent depression  may include exaggerated concerns, misperceptions  and continual self-criticism.

It is related  to many factors, including a family history of  depression, psychosocial stressors, diseases, alco- hol, drugs, gender and age. Depression occurs in  mood disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic dis- orders, adjustment disorders and psychoactive  substance use disorders, including alcoholism. Indi- viduals who have personality disorders, especially  obsessive-compulsive, dependent, avoidant and  borderline personality disorders, are susceptible to  depression. Psychosocial Factors An individual’s lack of confidence in her inter- personal skills and personality traits such as over- dependency on others as a source of support and  self-esteem, perfectionism and unrealistic expecta- tions work together with psychosocial stressors to  cause depression. Such psychosocial events include  death of a spouse, loss of a job and, for some, urban  living. Social Learning Theory Some psychologists say that stress disrupts involve- ment with others, resulting in a reduction in degree  and quality of positive reinforcement. This leads to  more negative self-evaluation and a poor outlook of  the future. Depressed people view themselves and  the world negatively, which leads to a further sense  of low self-worth, feelings of rejection, alienation,  dependency, helplessness and hopelessness. Cognitive Theory Often unrecognized negative attitudes toward the  self, the future and the world result in feelings of  failure, helplessness and depression. These distorted  attitudes may activate a prolonged and deepening  depressive state, especially under stress. Learning  what they are, understanding their negative distor- tions and challenging those hopeless and negative  thoughts in real life can reverse both depression  and a tendency for future depression. Psychoanalytic Theory A psychoanalytic position regarding depression is  that a loss, or a real or perceived withdrawal of  affection, in childhood may be a predeterminant  of depression in later life. Sigmund Freud and  Karl Abraham mentioned the role of ambivalence  toward the lost love object, identification with the  lost object and subsequent anger turned inward. Later theories suggested an unrealistic expec- tation of self and others and loss of self-esteem as  essential components leading to depression. Depres- sion arising after a saddened reaction in experienc- ing loss may result from a failure to work through  the loss. Interpersonal Theory This theory emphasizes the importance of social  connections for effective functioning. An individ- ual develops adaptive responses to the psychosocial  environment during early developmental experi- ences. When early attachment bonds are disrupted  or impaired, the individual may be vulnerable later  on to more interpersonal and social problems that  lead to depression. Genetic Factors Some individuals may be biologically predisposed  to develop depression, based on genetic factors  that researchers do not yet fully understand. There  are genetic markers that indicate susceptibility to  manic-depressive illness, and considerable research  has been under way in the last 25 years toward  understanding the biochemical reactions controlled  by these genes. There is considerable evidence that depression  runs in families. For example, if one identical twin  suffers from depression or manic-depression, the  other twin has a 70 percent chance of also having  the illness. Research studies looking at the rate of  depression among adopted children have supported  this finding. Depressive illnesses among children’s  adoptive family had little effect on their risk for the  disorder; however, among adopted children whose  biologic relatives suffered depression, the disorder  was three times more common than the norm.  Among more severe depressives, family history is  more often a significant factor.

Over the last several years,  newer antidepressants have emerged, such as ser- traline, paroxetine, fluoxetine and bupropion, that  offer the advantages of antidepressants with more  favorable side-effect profiles and a decreased poten- tial for lethality in overdose. However, research has  shown that while these agents have unique side- effect profiles, their overall efficacy appears to be  no greater than conventional antidepressant treat- ments and they also have a delayed onset of action.

      "AI: As a professional health counselor, social media can have both positive and negative impacts on mental health. On the positive side, social media can provide a platform for social connection, support, and community engagement. It can help individuals stay connected with friends and family, access information and resources, and share experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, social media can also have negative effects on mental health. Excessive use of social media can lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. Comparison with others, cyberbullying, and exposure to unrealistic standards can contribute to negative self-esteem and body image issues. Additionally, constant exposure to curated and filtered content can distort reality and create feelings of inadequacy.\n",

Many veterans of the war in Iraq,  which began in 2003, suffer from PTSD and are  receiving treatment to overcome their flashbacks,  depression, nightmares, and feelings of constant  vigilance. Along with shared anxieties, many people  have their own private mental health concerns.  Depression hits more than 1 9 million U.S. adults  each year. Of those, 12 million are women. About  one in eight U.S. women will be diagnosed with  depression during her lifetime. Depression is a  leading cause of drug and alcohol use. Drug and  alcohol addictions continue to incur huge costs for  society, such as emergency medical care crime,  corrections, law enforcement, lost productivity,  education, treatment and prevention. Sleep diffi- culties resulted in 45 million prescriptions being  written for sleep medications in 2005. Many peo- ple manage their anxieties by overeating or smok- ing. In the long run, unhealthy ways of coping take  their toll on physical as well as mental health. Research in the area of therapies for many var- ied mental health issues is ongoing. In the last few  years, the professional community has given much  attention to the use of medications known as atyp- ical antidepressants. Many of these new pharma- ceutical tools have been approved and have been  useful for some people. Another area of ongoing research involves  determining a definition of happiness and how  various people interpret happiness.

Happiness is very difficult  to attain without good mental health and matu- rity, but even then it requires conscious attention.  It is attainable through developing the capacity to  see beyond moments of disappointment and hurt,  beyond the mundane experience of living, and  to appreciate life’s beauty, the miracle of human  consciousness and life itself. Depression, anxieties,  addictive behaviors and severe physical pain make  it difficult to attain happiness by interfering with  the ability to see beyond one’s immediate negative  experience.

People want to feel that they can rely on  their friends and that their friends will be open and  honest with them. Friendships are involved in maintaining good  mental health. Friendships can be supportive in our  daily lives as well as during periods of turmoil or  crisis. Individuals who experience depression often  report a lack of friends, although having a wide cir- cle of friends is not a preventive factor for depres- sion. Some reports have indicated that individuals  who have many social contacts may be healthier  and actually live longer than those who do not. Friendships also affect mental health because  they may challenge or be challenged by other rela- tionships in contemporary life. For example, an  employer, supervisor or teacher, particularly one  with an authoritarian personality, may feel that  friendships among students or employees give them  too much power as a group. In the workplace, a  friendship may dissolve when one is promoted and  the other stays behind. A friendship may be broken  or changed when one friend marries, and disrup- tive friendships can weaken a marriage. A friend of  the opposite sex is frequently unsettling to a spouse  or lover. Friends who do not meet with parents’  approval can also be a source of family conflict.  Friends who decide to share housing or enter into a  business partnership sometimes learn about unde- sirable qualities of the other that could be ignored  when the relationship was less formal. The freedom inherent in friendship has its nega- tive as well as positive aspects. There are fewer social  rules about friendship than other relationships, and  two people may have entirely different expectations  from each other until those expectations clash. The  lack of structure for friendships may also allow one  friend to take the other for granted until the friend- ship disintegrates. Among early humans, friendship was a band- ing together to avoid danger. In contemporary life,  friendship may again play a role in combating the  physical and psychological dangers of high crime  and anonymity of modern urban life. The nuclear family of modern life puts increas- ing pressures on family members to be one anoth- er’s friends. Parents and children, husbands and  wives who, in the past, may have had a network  of relatives and longtime friends now turn to their  immediate family for friendship, not always with  satisfactory results. A Gallup poll reported in 1990 showed that  the typical American places much importance on  friendship and indicates some frustrations that peo- ple have in forming friendships. Friendship requires  time and a certain degree of flexibility. Twenty-five  percent of the total surveyed said that they did not  have enough time to spend with friends, and 46  percent of those who said they would like to have  more friends indicated, almost in contradiction,  that they did not have enough time to spend with  the friends they had. Working women and couples  with children at home were most likely to feel that  they had insufficient time to spend with friends. The survey showed that women and men approach  friendship quite differently. Women tended to form  more intimate relationships with other women than  men with men. One to one activities that promote  conversation are more popular with women, whereas  men are more likely to get together in groups for  activities such as sports or cards. Men rely on their  wives for emotional support rather than other men;  but many women, even those who are married, often  rely on other women. Women are more likely than  men to have a best friend of the same sex. Almost a  third of the men surveyed said a woman was their  best friend. When participants were asked about arguments  with friends, those under age 30 reported more dis- agreements.

For good  mental health, individuals have a need for positive  self-regard, much of which comes from approval  (or disapproval) from significant others. When good  habits are praised and rewarded, they are rein- forced; when bad habits are ignored and rewards  are withheld or punished (negative reinforcement),  presumably they will diminish. In daily life as well  as in therapy, individuals can be motivated to  change behavior patterns to include more adaptive  responses and more socially acceptable behaviors.  Methods of reinforcement may include rewards  such as privileges or increased social interactions.  There is evidence suggesting that in humans posi- tive reinforcement works better than negative rein- forcement to change behavior. relationships Relationships are formed between  individuals connected by affinity. These relation- ships include the individual’s family, spouse, lovers,  friends and business or professional associates. Good  relationships are healthy and nurturing and act as a  buffer against stress on good mental health. How- ever, even the most meaningful relationships can at  times be nonsupportive and sources of anxiety. Relationships and Health Best friends are invaluable to good mental health. A  best friend is on the same wavelength as you; under- stands your personal situations, such as dealing with  a difficult boss or overbearing parent; appreciates  and admires who you are, even if there is not always  agreement on what is being done or said; makes you  feel important in his or her life; is very much like  you and has the same values and belief systems. People who lack outlets for anxiety release are  susceptible to a list of anxiety-related illnesses.  Having one or two close friends with whom they  feel free to say anything is invaluable. When they  are overwhelmed, they do not trust their own  judgment, and an objective view from a friend can  help. Romantic Relationships Romantic relationships are far riskier and poten- tially more anxiety producing to the individual’s  emotional and physical well-being than people  realize. Not only are feelings likely to be hurt, self- esteem damaged and trust betrayed, but there can  be physical and mental battery by an outraged  spouse. America’s high divorce rate suggests that  intimacy has painful consequences. According to Geraldine K. Piorkowski, author of  Too Close for Comfort: Exploring the Risks of Intimacy,  romantic relationships can produce anxiety because  they are related to the process of getting close to  another person. As we become more intimate (both  emotionally and sexually), we reveal our deepest  secrets, hopes, inadequacies and even fantasies.  We become more vulnerable, and thus easily cut  to the core by a hostile comment, act of betrayal or  moment of rejection. Furthermore, Piorkowski says, anxiety arises  in relationships when our emotional needs and  expectations are unrealistic. Also, we may lose our  autonomy and wind up feeling suffocated by the  other’s demands; their neediness may drain energy  needed to pursue our own desires and interests. We  may be blamed for all the problems in the relation- ship and suffer guilt and loss of self-confidence as  a result. Relationships and Support Groups A lack of connections with other people can be det- rimental to good mental health, says Dr. Andrew  Weil, author of Spontaneous Healing. “Surrounding  yourself with supportive people is an important  step for any healing you need to do. Whenever I  take a family history from a patient, I always ask  about people who are helping or hindering some- one’s illness. For example, sometimes a friend or  family member who means well only make matters  worse, maybe by not wanting the patient to express  relationships    371 HOW A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP CAN CONTRIBUTE TO  BETTER MENTAL HEALTH \\x81 realism: openness and honesty with each other \\x81 trust: allowing the individuals to share their feelings'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='0i-viii_mentalhealth_fm.indd   viii 9/27/07   10:24:35 AM'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 379}, page_content='relationships    371 HOW A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP CAN CONTRIBUTE TO  BETTER MENTAL HEALTH \\x81 realism: openness and honesty with each other \\x81 trust: allowing the individuals to share their feelings \\x81 true friendship: having no hidden motives \\x81 forgiveness: accepting the individual as he or she is \\x81  security: knowing that individuals can count on one  another \\x81  vulnerability: exposing weaknesses that allow the  relationship to grow 001-476_mentalhealth_a-z.indd   371 9/27/07   12:34:50 PM'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 236}, page_content='an extensive resource library of the literature in the  field and responds to requests for information.

On virtually every indicator of mental and phys- ical health, job loss due to layoffs has a negative  impact. People who lose their jobs are often anx- ious, depressed, unhappy and, in general, dissatis- fied with their lives. They have lowered self-esteem,  are short-tempered and are fatalistic and pessimis- tic about the future.

However, if detected early enough, lead  poisoning can be treated, Lead encephalopathy  is a brain disorder seen in children who eat lead- containing paint. Symptoms include convulsions,  mania, delirium and coma. (Lead encephalopathy  can also occur in adults who inhale tetraethyl lead  in gasoline fumes.) learned helplessness  A term developed during  the 1970s by Martin Seligman (1942– ) to refer to  a feeling of helplessness and stifling of motivation  caused by exposure to aversive events over which  the individual has no control, sometimes leading to  depression. When individuals believe they have no control  over their situation, they feel powerless and helpless.  Having no ability to gain praise or positive reinforce- ments, they become passive and nonassertive. Under  these circumstances, tendencies toward depression  increase. The situation develops sooner or later in  individuals who experience their efforts having no  positive effect on a negative or painful situation. This researcher said that self-initiated behavior is  learned and that hindrance to initiation contributes  to the helpless feeling the individual develops over  time. However, there is emerging evidence that the  development of learned helplessness or resistance  to this development in experimental animals may  be controlled by a genetic trait and modified by  drugs used to treat depression. See also LEARNED OPTIMISM. learned optimism An attempt to identify habits of  thinking that lead to negative feelings and giving up  (learned helplessness), coined by Martin Seligman  (1942– ) and reverse them so that when under  stress or facing a failure, an individual may persist or  fight back and not “give up.” Examples of such nega- tive beliefs are: (1) If I fail, it is always my fault. (2) If  I fail in one area, I will fail in others. (3) If I fail now,  I will continue to fail. Seligman attempts to show  how reversal of these responses can produce learned  optimism. Seligman expounded on this theory in  his book Helplessness: On Depression, Development, and  Death (San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1975). See also LEARNED HELPLESSNESS. learning disabilities A group of psychological and  neurological disorders that interfere with learning  or make learning impossible. Children with learn- ing disabilities are often taunted by their peers,  which further reduces their sense of self-esteem and  motivation. Learning disorders are generally diffi- cult to diagnose; after diagnosis, children should be  observed and taught by specialists in their educa- tion. Such disabilities include problems in learning  caused by defects in speech, hearing and memory  but do not include disabilities due to emotional or  environmental deprivation or to poor teaching. There are some specific learning disabilities. For  example, dyslexia is difficulty reading; dyscalculia  is an inability to perform mathematical problems;  and dysgraphia refers to writing disorders. Specific  learning difficulties in children of normal intel- ligence may be caused by forms of minimal brain  dysfunction, which may be inherited.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 436}, page_content='stressors and ineffective coping methods.

Theories and techniques of studying this  type of nonverbal communication were developed  by Ray L. Birdwhistell (1918–94), who found that  certain gestures and expressions were specifically  male or female and also related to regional and  national groups. Body language also changes with  mood, health, age and degree of tension or relax- ation. Birdwhistell developed his theories with the  use of photography and with a notation system of  symbols called kinegraphs to describe gestures and  expressions. See also BODY LANGUAGE.

An  example is shoplifting, which accounts for count- less lost millions of dollars’ worth of merchandise  from retail businesses around the world. Klep- tomania may be a form of compulsion, similar to  compulsive gambling in some cases. Some klepto- maniacs are highly professional people and, when  apprehended, have no explanation for their behav- ior. Some kleptomaniacs perform their compulsion  frequently; others are very selective and only do  it when they believe that they will not be caught.  Many famous and highly respected people are  arrested in the United States every year for petty  thievery, some of which may be compulsive. See also OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER.

His work combined an interest  in neurology, neuropathology and literature that  led him to psychoanalysis. He developed a “self  psychology” theory that challenged many of the  theories of Sigmund Freud. Although Freudian in  his training, Kohut differed with Freud’s concept of  sex and aggression as the basis of human emotion  and personality structure. Instead he explored his  interest in the narcissistic personality, which he felt  was caused by social and family pressures rather  than Oedipus conflict. Those who have followed his  teachings and applied his theories in working with  patients are known as Kohutians. His major works  include The Analysis of the Self (1971), The Restoration  of the Self (1977) and The Search for the Self (1978). Kohut also differed from contemporary mental  health practitioners and aroused criticism by being  supportive to his patients rather than using the  usual confrontational, challenging methods com- mon in the field. Kohut was born in Vienna; in the  United States he worked at the University of Chi- cago hospitals and the Institute for Psychoanalysis  of Chicago.

Generally, the risk of suicide  appears to be greatest in the early course of depres- sive illness (first three episodes) and decreases as  drive and affect are “burned out” and life becomes  a kind of partial death, without ambition and seem- ingly without purpose. The Chronically Suicidal Individual Repeated communication of a wish to die or sui- cidal thoughts is a characteristic of the chronically  suicidal person. However, this in itself is not suf- ficient to distinguish the high- from the low-risk  individual, since it has also been observed that the  majority of the much larger group of patients who  attempt but do not complete suicide also convey  intent in advance. Intense dependency is often an underlying  dynamic in the suicidal individual. This depen- dency has been observed throughout all spheres  of the suicidal individual’s lifestyle, where inor- dinately excessive demands are made on others  for constant attention, affection and approval. The  individual also feels unable to cope by himself,  thereby needing continual supervision and guid- ance. Others have independently observed this  basic feeling of helplessness in patients who com- mit suicide. CHRONIC PRE-LETHAL FEATURES* 1. suicidal communications 2.  symbiotic dependency and reliance on external  controls 3. rigid thinking 4. paranoid traits 5. externalized anger 6. intermittent loss of control 7. chronic stimulus seeking 8. impaired personal coping Tendencies toward rigid thinking that does not  allow for alternatives in a crisis—and thinking in  opposites—have been observed in the personali- ties of many suicidal individuals. Perfectionism as  a personality trait is carried to a pathological state,  and this finds expression in the form of an anxious  striving toward perfection in all undertakings. A less commonly recognized characteristic  repeatedly associated with a high risk of suicide is  paranoia. While paranoia can serve as a temporary  defense against depression, unrecognized suicidal  impulses may result when this defense fails. Sigmund Freud viewed suicide and depression as  unconscious rage toward a lost loved object turned  back on oneself; however, cases have suggested a  high frequency of externalized anger and even vio- lent tantrums in the histories of patients who com- mit suicide or make serious attempts. Perhaps the most important characteristic of the  chronically high-risk individual is that of impaired  capacity for interpersonal relating. One study  showed that 91 percent of those who completed  suicide made no attempt to communicate their  intent just prior to their suicide, but the suicide- gesture group contacted a significant other 73 per- cent of the time. Assessing Acute Pre-lethal Factors Mental health professionals are often placed in a  difficult position regarding a patient’s family or  friends when they believe that suicide is a strong  imminent possibility. However, there are a number  of acute behavioral and situational factors found  with the greatest frequency in seriously attempted  and completed suicides. Situational Precursors of Suicide The most commonly understood instances of  increased suicidal risk in the depressed individual  are situations associated with separation or loss.  The loss does not necessarily have to be the final  loss or death of a loved one as Freud emphasized,  but it may be simply a temporary loss to the indi- vidual who is in a depressive crisis. For example,  losses may be spouse, home, job, hospital discharge,  temporary separation from therapist, money, love,  and so on. suicide    437'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 478}, page_content='might make you angry.

According to Jeff Zwiefel, M.S.,  Director, The National Exercise for Life Institute,  physical strength and stamina and a confident atti- tude are the main by-products of exercise. A study  at Baruch College, New York, found that people  who are stronger and more muscularly fit have a  significantly better self-image than their peers. Psy- chological tests have discovered that those who  exercise are more confident, emotionally stable and  outgoing than those who are sedentary. Joan C. Gondola, associate professor of physical  education at Baruch College, found the same posi- tive results of exercise on creativity levels when she  administered a test on female college students. One  group had exercised 20 minutes before the tests  and the other group had not; the exercise group  had more imaginative responses than those that  had not. The boost in creativity may be attributed to the  release of adrenaline and endorphins during exer- cise. The right side of the brain is stimulated by  these chemicals, which control creative and intui- tive processes. Exercise is an excellent way to relieve stress,  whether caused by pressures at work, family ten- sions or grief. However, exercise may also become  a compulsion, when the individual drops other  responsibilities in favor of improving body image or  losing weight. Because of our society’s emphasis on  a thin, slender body shape, many individuals have  become exercise addicts. For some individuals, such  addiction interferes with their mental well-being.  An example is compulsive exercise that accompa- nies eating disorders. See BODY IMAGE; RESOURCES. experiential family therapy A type of family ther- apy emphasizing experiences between family mem- bers and between family members and therapist  during therapy. The therapy is based on humanistic  approaches that focus on helping family members  learn to use symptoms and anxieties constructively.  It is also known as symbolic- experiential family  therapy. See also PSYCHOTHERAPIES. exposure therapy  Behavioral therapies that  emphasize changing an individual’s responses to  phobic situations while gradually increasing expo- sure to the feared situation. Exposure therapy may  be effective for some phobias and for agoraphobia;  to be effective, appropriate drug therapy is also  used in many cases.

The system consists  of nerve pathways linking nerve nuclei in the sur- face of the cerebrum (the main mass of the brain),  the basal ganglia deep within the brain and parts of  the brain stem. Degeneration of or damage to parts  of the system can cause disturbances in execution  of voluntary (willful) movements and in muscle  tone and can cause the appearance of involuntary  (unwanted) movements such as tremors or writh- ing motions. Disturbances of this type occur in  Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and some  types of cerebral palsy. Extrapyramidal side effects can also occur as a  result of taking some phenothiazine drugs, used for  treating some mental disorders.

Extroverts like to be  with people, work well in groups and are often  leaders. How and why personality traits develop is  unknown.

For good  mental health, individuals have a need for positive  self-regard, much of which comes from approval  (or disapproval) from significant others. When good  habits are praised and rewarded, they are rein- forced; when bad habits are ignored and rewards  are withheld or punished (negative reinforcement),  presumably they will diminish. In daily life as well  as in therapy, individuals can be motivated to  change behavior patterns to include more adaptive  responses and more socially acceptable behaviors.  Methods of reinforcement may include rewards  such as privileges or increased social interactions.  There is evidence suggesting that in humans posi- tive reinforcement works better than negative rein- forcement to change behavior. relationships Relationships are formed between  individuals connected by affinity. These relation- ships include the individual’s family, spouse, lovers,  friends and business or professional associates. Good  relationships are healthy and nurturing and act as a  buffer against stress on good mental health. How- ever, even the most meaningful relationships can at  times be nonsupportive and sources of anxiety. Relationships and Health Best friends are invaluable to good mental health. A  best friend is on the same wavelength as you; under- stands your personal situations, such as dealing with  a difficult boss or overbearing parent; appreciates  and admires who you are, even if there is not always  agreement on what is being done or said; makes you  feel important in his or her life; is very much like  you and has the same values and belief systems. People who lack outlets for anxiety release are  susceptible to a list of anxiety-related illnesses.  Having one or two close friends with whom they  feel free to say anything is invaluable. When they  are overwhelmed, they do not trust their own  judgment, and an objective view from a friend can  help. Romantic Relationships Romantic relationships are far riskier and poten- tially more anxiety producing to the individual’s  emotional and physical well-being than people  realize. Not only are feelings likely to be hurt, self- esteem damaged and trust betrayed, but there can  be physical and mental battery by an outraged  spouse. America’s high divorce rate suggests that  intimacy has painful consequences. According to Geraldine K. Piorkowski, author of  Too Close for Comfort: Exploring the Risks of Intimacy,  romantic relationships can produce anxiety because  they are related to the process of getting close to  another person. As we become more intimate (both  emotionally and sexually), we reveal our deepest  secrets, hopes, inadequacies and even fantasies.  We become more vulnerable, and thus easily cut  to the core by a hostile comment, act of betrayal or  moment of rejection. Furthermore, Piorkowski says, anxiety arises  in relationships when our emotional needs and  expectations are unrealistic. Also, we may lose our  autonomy and wind up feeling suffocated by the  other’s demands; their neediness may drain energy  needed to pursue our own desires and interests. We  may be blamed for all the problems in the relation- ship and suffer guilt and loss of self-confidence as  a result. Relationships and Support Groups A lack of connections with other people can be det- rimental to good mental health, says Dr. Andrew  Weil, author of Spontaneous Healing. “Surrounding  yourself with supportive people is an important  step for any healing you need to do. Whenever I  take a family history from a patient, I always ask  about people who are helping or hindering some- one’s illness. For example, sometimes a friend or  family member who means well only make matters  worse, maybe by not wanting the patient to express  relationships    371 HOW A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP CAN CONTRIBUTE TO  BETTER MENTAL HEALTH \\x81 realism: openness and honesty with each other \\x81 trust: allowing the individuals to share their feelings'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 479}, page_content='walk, doing some other form of exercise, playing a  musical instrument or listening to music.

Emotional consequences affect  not only the patient but the immediate caregivers  and family as well. Many families let anxieties take  over their lives; in other cases, depression arises  while coping with illness and the threat of possible  loss of physical functioning or life itself. Many ill persons turn to substance abuse to  escape their pain and fears about disability and  death. Anger, denial or perceived helplessness  leads others to abandon treatment or assume a  “why me” attitude that gives them a pessimistic  view of their world. According to Lloyd D. Rud- ley, M.D., an attending psychiatrist at the Institute  of Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia, the cru- cial issue is “whether you can get past the stage of  rage, sadness and overwhelming anxiety. Will you  resume the initiative for living or become psycho- logically paralyzed?” Dr. Rudley says that many  people become trapped by emotions that do not  serve them well. Reactions to illness are similar to the stages of  grief. First there is shock and a feeling of many  losses, including a sense of control, autonomy and  the way things used to be. Those who suffer from  chronic illness might suffer losses ranging from  having to give up a cherished sport or favorite food  to impaired speech or the inability to bear children.  Stress and symptoms of depression may follow,  including hopelessness, self-blame, shattered self- esteem or withdrawal. The ill person may develop  many fears, including one of being active again,  while others may deny the realities of their condi- tion and overdo activities too soon. Many chronically ill people do not comply with  instructions from their physicians. This may take  the form of not showing up for physical therapy,  refusing medication or driving a car against the  physician’s advice. Individuals with emphysema  may continue to smoke. According to Dr. Rudley,  “People want to think everything will be normal  again if they follow the doctor’s orders. When  things don’t work this way and there is no magic  formula, a patient may give up on treatment.” Some individuals neglect medical advice as a  means of getting more attention. Others who har- bor shame or guilt about their condition may pun- ish themselves, in effect, by not complying with  prescribed treatment. Forces of denial may be at  work, too, in whose who try to “bargain with ill- ness” by following some recommendations but not  others. An individual’s prior coping abilities will deter- mine how well he or she responds when illness  occurs. However, even when symptoms of illness  go into remission or the person adjusts successfully,  a whole new set of external problems may discrim- inate against him or her, or family dynamics can  change dramatically. “Patients need to accept that illness changes  them permanently, that a change in lifestyle is nec- essary,” advises Dr. Rudley. Healthy acceptance is  achieved when people come to terms with their ill- ness as a part of who they are, “forming a sort of  coexistence with it.” Some individuals feel certain “benefits” from  being chronically ill. Such motivations are referred  to as secondary gains and increase the likelihood of  the individual continuing to be ill or to have symp- toms. Common benefits of illness include receiving  permission to get out of dealing with a troublesome  problem, situation or responsibilities of life, getting  attention, care or nurturing from people around  them and not having to meet their own or others’  expectations. Ill health affects every area of a person’s life,  including marriage, family, work, financial affairs'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 379}, page_content='relationships    371 HOW A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP CAN CONTRIBUTE TO  BETTER MENTAL HEALTH \\x81 realism: openness and honesty with each other \\x81 trust: allowing the individuals to share their feelings \\x81 true friendship: having no hidden motives \\x81 forgiveness: accepting the individual as he or she is \\x81  security: knowing that individuals can count on one  another \\x81  vulnerability: exposing weaknesses that allow the  relationship to grow 001-476_mentalhealth_a-z.indd   371 9/27/07   12:34:50 PM'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 472}, page_content='464 vacations According to Emrika Padus in The Com- plete Guide to Your Emotions and Your Health  (Rodale  Press, 1992), “getting away from it all—breaking  free from routine—can bring a new perspective  to old dilemmas and put a positive charge in your  mental outlook. You’ll get to know yourself a little  better. And when you come home, you’ll be hap- pier, healthier and much more effective in coping  with stress.” The book offers many healthy reasons for taking  a vacation; Edward Heath, Ph.D., professor in the  department of Recreation and Parks, Texas A&M  University, and Richard I. Curtis, author of Taking  Off (Harmony Books, 1981) concur. These reasons  include: Getting away from the daily routine Relaxing Seeing new sights Opening up to different experiences Making new friends Sharing an event Learning new skills Participating in an adventure Enjoying beauty Anticipating pleasure Remembering the joy Said Dr. Heath, “The major goal of a vacation  is happiness. You leave your troubles behind you  . . . return refreshed and renewed. You should like  your life a little better after a vacation.” However, vacations do not always result in bet- ter mental health. Vacations themselves can add to  one’s stress load. First there is the choice of how  to travel—by car, train, ship or plane. Dealing with  reservations can produce anxious feelings. Packing  and preparing those left behind, in the case of fami- lies, can be difficult, especially when parents leave  young children. When grandparents take on the  responsibilities of caring for the children, intergen- erational conflicts may result. Delays of trains and planes, missed connections,  and accommodations not up to one’s expectations  can be stressful. Bad weather can do more than  dampen one’s spirits; weather affects the enjoy- ment level of many sites. Additionally, interper- sonal relationships are really put to the test on  vacations, as friends, couples or other groupings are  in close quarters and together every day. See also HOBBIES.

Vaginismus  is one of the more common sexual dysfunctions  that women experience. It is often triggered by a  distasteful or painful early sexual problem such  as rape or being the victim of sexual molestation.  It can also be caused by physical problems such  as chronic vaginitis or an imperforate hymen. At  times vaginismus treatment requires intensive psy- chotherapy to search into its causes; in other cases,  simply correcting a physical problem will alleviate  vaginismus. Behavioral modification techniques  have proven highly successful in treatment, based  on a woman and her partner practicing stretching  the vaginal opening, often with vaginal dilators.

The nor- mal number for humans is 46 chromosomes, or 23  pairs, which contain the genes for specific heredi- tary traits. Chromosomes are usually invisible  strands or filaments of DNA, RNA, or other mol- ecules carrying the genetic or hereditary traits of  an individual. Chromosomes are located in the cell  nucleus and are visible through a microscope only  during cell division. Defects in chromosomes can  result in birth defects or hereditary disorders. For  example, mental retardation is caused by absence  of part of a chromosome, a defective chromosome  or an extra chromosome. A condition known as tri- somy 21 is one that is associated with 85 percent of  Down syndrome cases. There are three number 21  chromosomes in the body cells instead of the nor- mal pair. The extra chromosome may come from  either the father or the mother. Some writers use  trisomy 21 as a synonym for Down syndrome. See DOWN SYNDROME; GENETIC COUNSELING; MEN- TAL RETARDATION.

See also CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME. chronic fatigue syndrome  (CFS) Illness charac- terized by fatigue that occurs suddenly, improves  and relapses, bringing on debilitating tiredness or  easy fatigability in an individual who has no appar- ent reason for feeling this way. It is stressful to the  sufferer because the profound weakness caused  by CFS does not go away with a few good nights  of sleep, but instead steals a person’s vigor over  months and years. Depression is probably a major  part of the syndrome. While the illness strikes children, teenagers, and  people in their fifties, sixties and seventies, it is most  likely to strike adults from their mid-twenties to  their late forties. Women are afflicted about twice  to three times as often as men; the vast majority  of those who suffer this illness are white. Because  young urban professionals were most afflicted dur- ing the 1980s, the name “yuppie flu” was attached  to CFS. However, most individuals felt that this  name trivialized their illness. Symptoms of CFS CFS can affect virtually all of the body’s major  systems: neurological, immunological, hormonal,  gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal. According to  the National Institutes of Health, CFS leaves many  people bedridden, or with headaches, muscular and  joint pain, sore throat, balance disorders, sensitivity  to light, an inability to concentrate and inexplicable  body aches.

Earlier forms of cognitive therapy were  introduced by Albert Ellis in the last 1960s under  the name Rational Emotive Therapy (RET). Cognitive therapy, like behavior therapy, has the  goal of helping the individual change the unwanted  behavior. It differs from radical behavior therapy  in that it does not focus only on overt behavior for  therapy. Instead, cognitive therapy emphasizes the  importance of the individual’s thoughts, feelings,  110    cofactors 001-476_mentalhealth_a-z.indd   110 9/27/07   12:34:08 PM'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 158}, page_content='Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy. This therapy  is based on the understanding that people’s emo- tions are controlled by their views and opinions of  the themselves and their world. Depression results  when individuals constantly berate themselves,  expect to fail, make inaccurate assessments of what  others think of them, overvalue situations, cata- strophize and have negative attitudes toward the  world and their futures. Therapists use techniques  of talk therapy to help the individual replace nega- tive beliefs and thought patterns. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT). Use of ECT  to treat depression has declined in the last two  decades as more effective medications have been  developed. However, ECT is still used for some  individuals who cannot take medications because  of their physical conditions or who do not respond  to anti- depressant medication. ECT is considered as  a treatment when all other therapies have failed or  when a person is suicidal.

The National Depressive and Manic-Depressive  Association is a national self-help organization,  formed in the early 1980s. Chapters throughout  the country meet locally to help members cope  effectively with depression.

The focus of behavioral therapy is on observ- able aspects of specific behaviors, such as the fre- quency or intensity of a physiological response  (e.g., sweating as a reaction to anxiety) or of obses- sive hand washing. Reports by the patient and self- rating scales are also often used to describe details  of behavior. Specific treatment techniques are tai- lored by each therapist to the particular needs of  each individual. Goals of treatment are determined by the thera- pist and the patient and often the patient’s family  64    behavioral health care firm 001-476_mentalhealth_a-z.indd   64 9/27/07   12:34:00 PM'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 73}, page_content='as well. The patient in behavioral therapy views  the therapist as a coach and usually makes choices  about trying to learn new behaviors and responses.  Usually the goal is for the patient to learn self-  control of her bad behaviors and increase her num- ber of revised, more acceptable, behaviors. A variety of learning techniques are used by  behavioral therapists. These include classical con- ditioning, desensitization, flooding, operant con- ditioning and modeling. In cases of social phobias,  for example, therapists may use techniques in  which the individual is gradually exposed to the  fear-producing situations. The exposure may take  place in the patient’s imagination first and then in  reality. Sometimes the reality never occurs (some  situations are easy to imagine but difficult to sim- ulate). However, the key to effective treatment is  the gradualness of the exposure combined with the  simultaneous use of relaxation training and new  physiological and behavioral responses. Exposure Therapy (Desensitization) Exposure therapy refers to many behavioral tech- niques that involve the use of gradual exposure to  an anxiety-producing situation. These techniques  include systematic desensitization and exposure at  full intensity (flooding and implosive therapy). In systematic desensitization, a technique used  by behavioral therapists, patients learn to rank sit- uations that cause anxiety and distress, as well as  a variety of deep-muscle-relaxing techniques. For  example, an individual who fears the sexual act  might place coitus at the top of the list of activities  that make him or her anxious; thinking about sit- ting with a date in a restaurant might rank at the  bottom of the list. The individual is trained in relaxation, both  mental and physical. When these techniques are  mastered, the person is asked to imagine, in as  much detail as possible, the least fear-producing  item from the list; when a comfort level is reached  in imagining this item, the patient can move up  the hierarchy with success. However, when the  individual has completed treatment and goes out  in the real world to face anxieties and fears, there  may be slight regression down the list. For exam- ple, an individual who has learned to remain calm  while walking into a party and meeting new people  may not be comfortable alone with a date. How- ever, the individual will eventually be able to move  from nonthreatening group social events to more  intimate settings and progress to a desired level of  sexual behavior. Systematic desensitization was explained in  1958 by Joseph Wolpe, an American psychiatrist  (1915–97). His first reports were on adults who had  many mental health problems, including obsessive- compulsive disorder, reactive depressions and pho- bias. He adapted his technique from experiences  gained in the 1920s when he worked with children  in overcoming phobias of animals. Flooding and Implosive Therapy Flooding is another technique used by behavioral  therapists. The individual is asked to experience  an anxiety-producing situation by imagination or  in actuality (in vivo) while experiencing the sup- portiveness of the therapist. Then the individual  is directly exposed to a high-intensity, peak level  of the anxiety-producing situation without ben- efit of a graduated approach, as is the case in the  systematic desensitization technique. The therapist  controls the content of scenes to be imagined and  experiences that reoccur. The therapist describes  scenes with great vividness, deliberately making  them as disturbing as possible to the anxious indi- vidual, who has not been instructed to relax. Pro- longed experience with these situations is planned  to help the individual to experience “extinction” of  the anxiety responses and thus overcome them. Implosive therapy is another technique used by  therapists. The individual is repeatedly encouraged  to imagine anxiety-producing situations at maxi-'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 74}, page_content='particular feared action, such as entering a room  full of strangers or being introduced to members  of the opposite sex. The fearful person experiences  extinction of the feared responses in a vicarious  way. This technique is really social learning or  observational learning. Modeling has another aspect; in “covert mod- eling” the anxious patient simply imagines that  another person faces the same anxieties or concerns  without unwanted physiological responses. Operant Conditioning This is a theory applied in behavioral therapy work.  Because people will either maintain or reduce fre- quency of certain behaviors because of responses  they get from their environment, behaviors that  produce reinforcing consequences can be strength- ened and behaviors producing unpleasant conse- quences reduced. Behaviors of avoidance in certain  situations are considered under “operant” control  and are thus changeable. Hypnosis and Biofeedback Hypnosis is considered a behavioral technique and  is often used in conjunction with other techniques.  Hypnosis can help the individual reach a trancelike  state in which he or she becomes extremely recep- tive to suggestion. Then, through posthypnotic  suggestions, the individual may learn to change  patterns of behavior, such as having fearful reac- tions to entering a room full of strangers at a party.  By itself, hypnosis is not considered an appropri- ate treatment for most mental health disorders. It is  often used to modify specific, unwanted behaviors,  such as smoking cigarettes. Biofeedback is often used in conjunction with  relaxation training and to enhance possibilities for  a person’s response to treatments. In biofeedback,  physiological reactions can be monitored electri- cally. An anxious person can learn to regulate cer- tain processes, such as breathing or heart rate. Family Therapy Behavioral techniques are often used in modifying  ways in which an individual interacts with other  members of his or her family. It is useful in some  cases of childhood behavior problems, school pho- bia and agoraphobia, in which other members of  the family “enable” the agoraphobic to persist in  fearful habits.

The benchmarking process identifies the best perfor- mance in the industry, such as health care, for a par- ticular process, determines how that performance  was achieved, and applies the lessons learned to  improve performance overall in similar situations. Benson, Herbert (1935– )  The founding presi- dent and associate chief of the Mind/Body Medical  Institute, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Harvard  Medical School, and chief of the Division of Behav- ioral Medicine, New England Deaconess Hospital. He is a cardiologist who discovered and described  how the relaxation response is a protective mecha- nism against overreaction to stress and anxieties. He  is the author and coauthor of several books relating  to relaxation and stress, including The Relaxation  Response and The Mind/Body Effect; hundreds of his  articles have appeared in medical journals and pop- ular magazines. Dr. Benson discovered the relaxation response  while studying people who practiced transcenden- tal meditation. As a specialist in high blood pres- sure, Dr. Benson’s particular interests have included  how the relaxation response can help people with  high blood pressure and other health concerns. He  warns that people with high blood pressure should  not just give up their medication. What medita- tion and the relaxation response do, he maintains,  is improve upon the benefit of the medication. He  argues that “mindfulness” is needed to be healthy  and productive.

Having a cup of coffee is also considered a  social experience, as it is an opportunity for indi- viduals to sit together and relax for a few moments  of conversation. Coffee is primarily a stimulant, as  it contains caffeine. Some individuals believe that  coffee gives them a feeling of instant energy and  use coffee to help wake themselves up or recharge  themselves throughout the day. This is so because  it affects the central nervous system, increasing  the heart action in rate and strength. There is also  increased activity of the kidneys, and brain centers  are aroused. Different individuals can tolerate dif- ferent levels of caffeine in coffee. Those who have  cardiac conditions or hyperthyroidism, in which  the heart is already overstimulated, should reduce  their coffee intake. Some people are overly sensi- tive to caffeine, while others overdose themselves,  developing anxiety, insomnia and irritability, all  symptoms of “caffeinism.” Individuals complaining  of anxiety symptoms or insomnia should be evalu- ated for excessive caffeine use or hypersensitivity. The effects of coffee are a significant pub- lic health issue, because according to the Coffee  Research Institute, in 1999 there were 108,000,000  coffee consumers in the United States.  They spent  approximately $9.2 billion in the retail sector and  $8.7 billion in the food service sector. It appears  that coffee drinkers spend an average of $164.71  per year on coffee. The National Coffee Association  found in 2000 that 54 percent of the adult popula- tion of the United States drinks coffee daily, and 25  percent of Americans drink coffee occasionally.

For example, in Alzheimer’s dis- ease, cognitive dysfunction begins early on in the  course of the disorder. There may be elements of  cognitive dysfunction in depression as well as many  other disorders. Certain medications may cause dose-related,  reversible cognitive dysfunction as side effects. For  example, tricyclic antidepressants and antihista- mines, because of their anticholinergic side effects,  may reduce short-term memory and word-finding  ability at high doses; the newer selective serotonin  reuptake inhibiting (SSRI) drugs, such as Prozac  and Zoloft, do not. Benzodiazepine tranquiliz- ers, such as alprazolam (Xanax), may also reduce  short-term memory at higher doses. Reduction of  dose will reverse these temporary effects, unless  the problem is related to another underlying cause,  such as depression. Cognitive dysfunction is used in another psycho- therapeutic context to refer to dysfunctional atti- tudes (heightened self-criticism, low self-esteem)  that lead to depression and anxiety. See also COGNITIVE THERAPY. cognitive therapy A therapeutic approach based  on the concept that anxiety problems result from  patterns of thinking and distorted attitudes toward  oneself and others and that changing one’s think- ing alters one’s behavior. Cognitive therapy is used  to treat depressed individuals and others who have  anxieties and phobias. One innovator during the  late 1970s was Aaron Beck (1921– ), an American  psychiatrist.

      "AI: As a professional health counselor, sadness and depression are two distinct emotional states. Sadness is a normal and temporary response to a specific event or situation that triggers feelings of sorrow, disappointment, or grief. It is a natural emotion that typically resolves on its own as the individual processes the triggering event.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, depression is a mental health disorder characterized by persistent and intense feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness that interfere with daily functioning and quality of life. Depression is more severe and long-lasting than sadness, and it can impact various aspects of a person's life, including relationships, work, and physical health.\n",
      "\n",

Many veterans of the war in Iraq,  which began in 2003, suffer from PTSD and are  receiving treatment to overcome their flashbacks,  depression, nightmares, and feelings of constant  vigilance. Along with shared anxieties, many people  have their own private mental health concerns.  Depression hits more than 1 9 million U.S. adults  each year. Of those, 12 million are women. About  one in eight U.S. women will be diagnosed with  depression during her lifetime. Depression is a  leading cause of drug and alcohol use. Drug and  alcohol addictions continue to incur huge costs for  society, such as emergency medical care crime,  corrections, law enforcement, lost productivity,  education, treatment and prevention. Sleep diffi- culties resulted in 45 million prescriptions being  written for sleep medications in 2005. Many peo- ple manage their anxieties by overeating or smok- ing. In the long run, unhealthy ways of coping take  their toll on physical as well as mental health. Research in the area of therapies for many var- ied mental health issues is ongoing. In the last few  years, the professional community has given much  attention to the use of medications known as atyp- ical antidepressants. Many of these new pharma- ceutical tools have been approved and have been  useful for some people. Another area of ongoing research involves  determining a definition of happiness and how  various people interpret happiness. Happiness  can be defined as a lasting state of mind charac- terized by contentment and acceptance as well  as engagement in life’s experiences with peri- o ds  o f  j o yfuln e s s  an d  a p p r e cia ti o n  as  o p p o s e d  t o   immediate pleasures. Happiness is very difficult  to attain without good mental health and matu- rity, but even then it requires conscious attention.  It is attainable through developing the capacity to  see beyond moments of disappointment and hurt,  beyond the mundane experience of living, and  to appreciate life’s beauty, the miracle of human  consciousness and life itself. Depression, anxieties,  addictive behaviors and severe physical pain make  it difficult to attain happiness by interfering with  the ability to see beyond one’s immediate negative  experience.

He is the author of popular books about mental  health, including Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday  Life (1993) and Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wis- dom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain and Ill- ness (1991). Dr. Kabat-Zinn is a proponent of mindfulness  meditation, a more than 2,000-year-old Buddhist  method of living fully in the present. This approach  offers a unique way to cope with stress and illness  because mindfulness meditation can help induce  deep states of relaxation and, at times, directly  improve physical symptoms. Other forms of meditation involve focusing on a  sound or the sensation of breath leaving and enter- ing the body; anything else that comes up in the  mind during meditation is seen as a distraction to  be disregarded. Mindfulness, on the other hand,  is “insight” meditation. It encourages one to note  any thoughts and observe them nonjudgmentally,  moment by moment, as they occur in one’s aware- ness. This practice of observing thoughts, feelings  and sensations can help one become calmer and  have a broader perspective on one’s life. It involves  a significant commitment to oneself; it is a way of  life. In his writings, Dr. Kabat-Zinn explains how to  live in the moment by taking up such techniques  as “non-doing,” trust and concentration. He shows  readers meditation postures and describes ways to  meditate, including visualizing mountains and lakes  and concentrating on walking or standing. Like many mind/body techniques, mindfulness  has just begun to be explored scientifically. Typi- cally, the training program for mindfulness medi- tation lasts eight weeks. Controlled studies are  investigating whether mindfulness meditation can  influence the healing process and help in treating  many diseases.

Frank Lawlis, Ph.D., wrote “People [in Japan]  are literally dying at their workstations. It appears  that their entire physiological system collapses or  shuts down.” Lawlis drew from a 1989 study by Chiyoda Fire  and Marine Insurance, Ltd., one of the top insur- ance carriers in Japan. Chiyoda, which covers more  than 100,000 Japanese corporations, conducted a  major study on the health problems Japanese peo- ple are likely to encounter. One important conclu- sion of the study was that stress played a major role  in 40 percent of the health problems. In 1997 Dr. Katsuo Nishiyama of Japan, published  a paper in the International Journal of Health Services   (February 4, 1997) in which he reviewed the history  of karoshi and progress to stop the increase in the  disease. The process of work intensification, he said,  has resulted in night shift work, increased scheduled  and unscheduled overtime and holiday work and  formal and informal functions during off-work time.

Individuals who meditate frequently report that  they are more aware of their own opinions after  beginning meditation. They are not as easily influ- enced by others as they were previously and can  arrive at decisions more quickly and easily. They  may be more self-assertive and more able to stand  up for their own rights effectively. Additionally,  researchers have shown that the meditating person  may become less irritable in his or her interpersonal  relationships within a relatively short period of time  after beginning meditation. Types of Meditation Modern meditation techniques are derived from  spiritual practices in Eastern cultures dating back  more than 2,000 years. Traditionally, the benefits  of the techniques have been defined as spiritual in  nature, and meditation has constituted a part of  many religious practices. In the latter part of the  20th century, however, simple forms of meditation  have been used for stress management with excel- lent results. Contributing to the rising interest is the  fact that these meditation techniques are related to  biofeedback (which also emphasizes a delicately  attuned awareness of inner processes) and to the  muscle relaxation and visualization techniques  used in behavior therapy. There are two basic types of meditation: con- centration and insight. Concentration types, such  as transcendental meditation, often use a special  sound or silently repeated phrase to focus attention  and to screen out extraneous thoughts or stimuli.  Insight-oriented meditations, such as mindfulness  meditation, accept the thoughts and feelings that  arise from moment to moment as objects of atten- tion and acceptance. The goal of mindfulness is an  increased awareness of what is happening in one’s  mind and body at that particular moment. Recogni- tion and acceptance of present reality provides the  basis for changes of attitudes and conditions.

Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)  The MMSE  is a method for assessing the cognitive status of  an individual. It is frequently used with elderly  patients. Evaluation of cognitive functioning is  important in clinical settings because of the high  prevalence of cognitive impairment in medical  patients. The MMSE can help health professionals  detect impairment, follow the course of an illness  and monitor response to therapy. MMSE has also  been used to screen for cognitive disorders and to  follow cognitive changes during clinical trials. The MMSE is a method to grade cognitive men- tal status and assess for orientation, immediate and  short-term recall, language and the ability to follow  simple verbal and written commands. The total score  places the individual on a scale of function so that  care can be appropriately prescribed and provided. Sample Mini-Mental State Examination In the section on orientation, the individual may  be asked \\x81 What is the day of the week? \\x81 What year was last year? \\x81 What is the street name? \\x81 What building are we in? In the section on memory, the first part tests the  ability to remember three words immediately. The  individual will be given the names of three objects  to remember, such as table, ball and pen. Then the  individual will be asked to repeat the three words. The section on attention and calculation tests the  ability to concentrate on a tricky task. The patient  will be asked to count backward. For example,  start at 50 and count backward by 5. The patient  also may be asked to spell a word, such as “lunch,”  backward. The final part of the test helps assess spoken and  written language and the ability to write and copy.  The person being tested is shown two everyday  items, such as a hammer and a crayon, and asked  to name them. The patient will then be asked to say  aloud a tongue-twister sentence such as “pass the  peas, please.” Then the person will be given a piece  of paper and asked to carry out three steps: \\x81 Take this paper in your hand. \\x81 Fold it in half. \\x81 Place it on this chair. A card is then shown with an instruction for a sim- ple task, such as “clap your hands.” The next stage of the test is to write a sentence on  a piece of paper. The sentence needs to make sense.  An acceptable sentence might be “It is a lovely day  today” or “My name is John.” Finally, the ability to copy a design of two inter- secting shapes is assessed. Copies of the complete test are available from  the Psychological Assessment Resources (PAR)  Web site: http://www.parinc.com. See also AGING; ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE. Folstein, M., S. Folstein, and P.

Medicaid A federal-state medical assistance pro- gram authorized in 1965 to pay for health care  services used by people defined as medically needy  or categorically needy. The latter type of persons  are low-income aged, blind, disabled, first-time  pregnant women or families with dependent chil- dren. Medically needy persons are any of the above  whose incomes are above eligibility limits for the  categorically needy but who have high medical  expenses that reduce their resources below estab- lished limits. See also MEDICARE. Medicare A nationwide, federally administered  health insurance program authorized in 1965  to cover the cost of hospitalization, medical and  mental health care and other related services. Eli- gible persons must be over age 65, receive Social  Security, or suffer from end-stage renal disease.  Medicare consists of two separate but coordinated  programs: hospital insurance (Part A) and supple- mentary medical insurance (Part B). Health insur- ance protection is available to insured persons  without regard to income. Medicare intermediaries or carriers are fiscal  agents (typically Blue Cross plans or commercial  insurance firms) under contract to the Health Care  Financing Administration for administration of spe- cific Medicare tasks. These tasks include determin- ing reasonable costs for covered items and services,  making payments and guarding against unneces- sary use of covered services for Medicare Part A  payments. Intermediaries also make payments for  home health and outpatient hospital services cov- ered under Part B. See also MEDICAID. Health Care Financing Administration. Medicare and You  2000.

One  directs thoughts away from work, family, relation- ships and the environment. During meditation, the  heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen- consumption  rate decreases, temperature of the extremities rises  and muscles relax. Meditation also has been shown to reduce a  number of medical symptoms and improve health- related attitudes and behaviors. People with heart  disease, hypertension, cancer, diabetes and chronic  pain have reported feeling more self-confident, more  in control in their lives and better able to mange  stress after mastering the meditation technique.  Meditation has been used successfully by individu- als who have panic attacks and panic disorder. Meditation may bring out increased efficiency  in the body by eliminating unnecessary expendi- tures of energy. Individuals who practice medita- tion sometimes report a beneficial surge of energy  marked by increased physical stamina, increased  productivity on the job, the end of writer’s or art- ist’s “block” and the release of previously unsus- pected creative potential. Learning to Meditate for Better Mental Health Meditation is a very self-disciplined routine that  provides a way to learn more about one’s thoughts  and feelings. Simple procedures can be learned eas- ily. The basics include sitting in a quiet room with  eyes closed, breathing deeply and rhythmically  with attention focused on the breath. Also, there  may be a focus on either a special word, or “man- tra,” such as “peace” or “om,” which one repeats  over and over again; others find steadily watching  an object, such as a candle flame for a 20-minute  period once or more daily, equally effective.

Yoga is a mental and physical dis- cipline intended to help one get in touch with one’s  true nature and mystical feelings outside everyday  existence and improve mental health. There are several types of yoga practice and vary- ing emphasis on physical, mental and social activity.  Some yoga disciplines are more spiritual and meta- physical. The most commonly practiced yoga in  the West is Hatha Yoga; it concentrates on spiritual  improvement through the practice of physical exer- cise, which consists of postures called asanas. Man- tras, or sacred sounds, are used in Mantra yoga. Still  another branch of yoga practice concentrates on the  kundalini or serpent power, which is thought to lie  at the base of the spine and which can be released  through postures, mantras and meditation. In some  yoga practice, various forms are combined. Yoga is an ancient practice that influenced and  was in turn influenced by Brahminism, Jainism,  Buddhism and Hinduism. Yoga practice started to  move westward as a result of the Muslim invasions  of India, but only the colonial expansion of the  British brought Europeans in contact with yoga. Critics of yoga say that it can be physically dan- gerous if practiced without supervision and that it  may lead to introversion or a hedonistic philoso- phy. The degree to which adherents depend on  their teacher or guru may decrease a sense of inde- pendence in the student and may give the teacher  too strong a sense of his own power. “Kundalini” and “Yoga,” In Harper’s Encyclopedia of Mys- tical and Paranormal Experience, edited by Rosemary  Ellen Guiley.

Yohimbine is  an alkaloid chemical derived from the bark of the  African yohimbe tree. Its use was first observed  by Europeans among natives in the 19th century;  samples were brought back to Germany for study.  The drug stimulates the nervous system and can  cause anxiety. It is dangerous in large doses. It is  sold under the trade name Yocon in the United  States for sexual performance disorders. There is  controversy concerning its effectiveness. youth See CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS AND YOUTH.

During psychoanalytic therapy, an  understanding and resolution of this process must  be achieved to understand how old conflicts could  be resolved more satisfactorily. Transference often occurs between patient and  physician, worker and boss, student and teacher,  but is not often recognized. Transference may be  positive (trusting, feelings of strength and sup- port) and negative (distrust, anger, anticipation of  criticism, etc.), often depending on the individual’s  experience with parent figures. The process is often  unconscious and unrecognized except in psycho- therapy with a well-trained therapist. It can lead to  very intense pervasive feelings.

The term “trans- sexualism” was coined by Harry Benjamin in 1966.  The first well-known case of transsexualism was  Christine Jorgensen, who had a sex change opera- tion from male to female in 1952. See also GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER. transvestitism Individuals who wear the clothing  of the other sex, a practice known as cross- dressing.  Transvestitism takes many forms. For example,  pseudotransvestites try cross-dressing for fun and  not to fulfill any need.

If you have trouble getting to sleep and staying  asleep long enough to feel good throughout the day,  try some of these suggestions: \\x81  Drink a cup of warm milk before bedtime. Eat  a light snack. Avoid stimulating beverages that  contain caffeine, such as coffee, cola beverages and  chocolate. \\x81 Take a warm, relaxing bath. \\x81  Relax in bed and read something you enjoy. As  your mind becomes engrossed, your muscles will  relax. When your body is relaxed, you are likelier  to become sleepy and ready for sleep. Watching  television may have the same effect. \\x81  Read something you ﬁ nd very dull. When your  mind cannot handle what you present, your  internal coping mechanism of falling asleep may  take over. Watching television may have the same  effect. \\x81  Experiment by changing your environment. Make the  room warmer or colder. Use different combinations  of covers. Some people like the feeling of the  “weight” of blankets, while others do not. If you  like warmth without weight, use an electric blanket.  Some have dual controls so that each bed partner  can have individual arrangements. \\x81  Avoid stressful situations before bedtime. Postpone  discussions of problems until morning when possible.  Avoid lengthy telephone conversations that may  upset you before bedtime. \\x81  If you have an argument or tension-ﬁ lled discussion  late at night, do not go to bed mad. \\x81  If you are alone and feel hostile, call a friend and  talk.

For example, the individual might be kept  awake during one full night or during specific hours  of several nights. This is termed sleep deprivation  therapy. Russian psychiatrists have used sedative  drugs to promote sleep for several days as a form  of therapy. This type of sleep therapy is not used in  the United States as a standard treatment.

For unknown reasons, boys  are more likely to sleepwalk than girls. A child may  sleepwalk after awakening from a nightmare or  night terror and may scream, talk or even urinate  in an inappropriate place. It is difficult to awaken a sleepwalker; the best  approach is to calmly lead him or her back to bed.  However, in a household where an individual is  known to sleepwalk, it is best to close off stairwells  and remove loose objects in the possible pathway  to prevent injury. Since somnambulism occurs during stage IV  sleep, it frequently responds to benzodiazepine  medications, such as flurazepam (Dalmane) or  temazepam (Restoril). slips of the tongue Also known as “lapsus lingae,”  slips of the tongue occur when one says one thing  but means another. Most people do this at times,  and doing so does not mean that one is losing one’s  memory. These are mistakes that grouped together  with other errors such as mislaying objects, memory  lapses and writing errors are known as symptomatic  acts. Sigmund Freud theorized that these acts have  a subconscious basis with some motivation that is  not recognized by the person who commits them.  This type of behavior is temporary and correctable.  Although undesirable, it tends to fall within normal  limits and is not considered pathological. Campbell, Robert Jean. Psychiatric Dictionary. New York,  Oxford University Press, 1981. smoking The actual physiological effects of smok- ing are somewhat at odds with the sensations that  smokers report. When nicotine enters the blood- stream, it raises the heart rate, blood pressure and  blood flow and dilates the arteries. It also raises the  level of glucose in the blood. However, smokers  report a sense of tranquility, despite the stimulating  effects of nicotine. Smoking is generally experienced as an uncom- fortable, negative experience the first time it is  attempted, but it soon becomes a habit that is dif- ficult to break despite its link with cancer and heart  disease. The habit of smoking is usually started in adoles- cence and seems to be a function of a desire to con- form to peer pressure. Rebellious attitudes, lower  socioeconomic status, desire for tension relief and  patterns of family smoking also seem to be factors  that contribute to teenage smoking. Despite warnings about the health hazards of  smoking, about 23 percent of U.S. adults were cur- rent smokers in 2001, according to the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention. Among adults,  about 19 percent smoked daily and about 4 percent  smoked less than daily. Daily smokers smoked an  average of 18 cigarettes a day compared with five  cigarettes a day for nondaily smokers on days that  they smoked. Approximately three in 10 current  smokers (30.9 percent) usually smoked 15–24 ciga- rettes in a day. Approximately three in 10 current  smokers (30.9 percent) started smoking before the  age of 16 years. About four in 10 current smok- ers (42.4 percent) attempted to quit smoking in the  past year. Nondaily smokers (54.3 percent) were  more likely than daily smokers (39.9 percent) to  have attempted to quit smoking in the past year.  Among nondaily smokers, quit attempts did not  show a clear association with age: 50–60 percent of  nondaily smokers had tried to quit smoking in the  past year, regardless of age.

This is an uncomfortable sensation  that occurs just before falling asleep. The individ- ual feels an urge to get up and walk around. This  sensation may increase with age and, according to  some researchers, frequently runs in families. It is  more common in individuals age 50 to 60 than in  younger people. Sleep Difﬁ culties of Menopausal Women Many women experience changes in their sleep  patterns around menopause. Some changes may be  due to hot flashes or to many other factors involv- ing other individual psychosocial stresses. Accord- ing to Dudley Dinner, M.D., director of the Sleep  Disorders Center, the Cleveland Clinic Foundation,  while women may have slept seven to eight hours  at age 20, they may decrease up to six or six and  a half hours between age 55 and 60. In addition,  sleep tends to become more “fragmented.” Women  in this age group may awaken more often and  spend more time awake during the night, although  the total time in bed may increase. Sleep Disturbance Related to Medication Because many medications can cause sleepiness in  some individuals, all such medications should be  taken only under a physician’s supervision. Some  medications may make sleep apnea worse. Medications Used for Inducing Sleep Many individuals have sleeping medications pre- scribed for them at some time during their life.  Often at a time of great bereavement, such as after  the death of a spouse or parent, an individual will  have difficulty sleeping and can be helped with the  assistance of an appropriately prescribed medica- tion for short-term use. Dreaming Most dreaming takes place during the REM (rapid- eye-movement) stage. Nightmares of being unable  to move have a real basis during this phase of sleep  because of the limpness of the muscles. Most people  forget dreams unless they awaken during a REM  period or within 10 minutes afterward. According to Dr. Cartwright, dreaming has a  role in our mental health. This is indicated by the  fact that people in poor mental health are distinctly  different. “Dreaming doesn’t cause mental illness,  but when dreams work well, they help process our  emotions of the day. We put our emotions to rest  during sleep. When we are upset, our dreaming  does not serve us well,” Dr. Cartwright said. Research Evaluation of individuals’ problems as well as sleep  research is carried out in many sleep laboratories  across the United States. Sessions for a troubled  sleeper in a sleep laboratory depend on the diagnosis  and how complex the problem is. Some tests, such as  those for narcolepsy—a disorder of excessive daytime  sleepiness—are done during the day, with a series of  five short naps. However, most sleep lab evaluations  are done during the night. Patients are monitored  for many things, including naso-oral air flow and  heart rate. Insomniacs are tested to determine how  much they really sleep. Typically, many physiological  parameters are measured on a 16-channel machine.  One person can be measured on 16 channels, or two  people on eight channels. There is an intercom from  the control room, and researchers can talk to any  sleeper in a room or tape-record from any room. With use of an electroencephalogram (EEG), a  graphic depiction of the brain’s electrical poten- tials recorded by scalp electrodes, sleep is divisible  into two categories: nonrapid-eye-movement sleep  (NREM) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep.  Dreaming sleep is another term for REM sleep.  There are four stage of NREM sleep. Stage I occurs  immediately after sleep begins with a pattern of low  amplitude and fast frequency. Stage II has charac- teristic waves of 12 to 16 cycles per second known  as sleep spindles. Stages III and IV have progressive  further slowing of frequency and increase in ampli- tude of the wave forms.

Snoring frequently results  when one sleeps on his or her back; the tongue  slides back into a position that partially blocks the  nasal passage, forcing one to breathe through the  mouth, particularly in a deep sleep. Snoring may  deprive both the snorer and the bed partner of nec- essary sleep, possibly resulting in irritability and  tension the next day. Snoring is more common in overweight people,  in part because they are more likely to sleep on  their backs and because fatty tissue in their throat  may cause blockage. Snoring may also be caused by  enlarged tonsils and nasal problems. Heavy drink- ing, smoking or eating just before sleep may also  cause snoring. Snoring is more common in men than in women  and tends to increase with age. A significant num- ber of snorers can be heard in the next room.  Measurements of snoring volume have recorded  decibel levels as high as the sound of a jackhammer  or pneumatic drill. Robert W. Hart, M.D., writing  about snoring in Chicago Medicine (December 21,  1991), characterized it as “mild, moderate, severe  or heroic.” According to Hart, the incidence of  habitual snoring in an unselected population has  been estimated near 20 percent. However, in over- weight males between the ages of 30 and 59, that  incidence reaches 60 percent. Some sources esti- mate that 40 million Americans snore. Snoring and Sleep Apnea Many individuals who report chronic fatigue  and irritability are victims of sleep apnea, known  as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). If  untreated, OSAS can have lethal consequences  when daytime sleepiness leads to automobile and  industrial accidents, as well as consequences for  interpersonal relationships because of short tem- pers due to tiredness. snoring    419 STRESS RELIEVERS FOR THOSE  WHO ARE QUITTING SMOKING \\x81 List your reasons for wanting to stop smoking. \\x81 Note when and where you smoke the most. \\x81 Set a date for quitting; tell your family and friends. \\x81  Remove cigarettes, ashtrays and matches from your  home, car and ofﬁ ce. \\x81  Minimize stressful situations and other occasions  where you previously craved a cigarette. \\x81 Spend time where smoking is prohibited. \\x81  Reach for high-ﬁ ber, low-calorie snacks, such as  vegetables or fruits, when you have the urge to  smoke. \\x81  Talk to someone who is supportive until the urge to  smoke passes. \\x81 Increase aerobic exercise (walking, biking). \\x81  Use relaxation techniques (meditation, guided  imagery). \\x81 Reward yourself for quitting smoking. TIPS FOR SNORERS \\x81 Learn to sleep on your side or stomach. \\x81  Attach something to the back of your pajamas or  nightgown to awaken yourself when you lie on your  back. \\x81  Avoid having an alcoholic nightcap, because it  aggravates snoring; alcohol causes too much  relaxation in the oralpharynx region. The same thing  happens after taking tranquilizers and sleeping pills. \\x81  Elevate the head of your bed several inches. This may  alleviate the tendency to snore. \\x81  Devices are available that help. One is a vinyl  molded tooth guard, much like an athletic mouth  guard, that captures and holds the tongue so that it  does not fall to the back of the throat. It makes the  airway stay open. \\x81  Masks are available for really heavy snorers. These  prevent snoring by supplying positive air pressure  and keeping the throat open. \\x81  Surgical techniques may be a last resort for an indi- vidual with severe and serious snoring problems.  One procedure involves tightening up the tissues in  the back of the throat. Another procedure involves  making a permanent hole in the breathing system  before the voice box. The hole bypasses the throat  area when open and prevents the movement of the  tissues that lead to snoring.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 420}, page_content='elevated blood pressure. Diagnosis of sleep apnea  can be made from a tape recording at the bedside  of the snorer. If there are repeated pauses of more  than 10 seconds between snores, it may mean that  the oxygen level in the brain is going down. The  person must wake himself to restart the brain. There  is treatment for sleep apnea, and it is important that  such people be treated because this disorder causes  a strain on the heart. 412    sleep 001-476_mentalhealth_a-z.indd   412 9/27/07   12:34:57 PM'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 421}, page_content='as sleep spindles.

This occurs  during and after exercise or in stressful or feared  situations. If the feeling lasts for several hours or  recurs over several days, or if it causes chest pain,  breathlessness or dizziness, a physician should be  consulted as soon as possible. Palpitations may be  caused by a cardiac arrhythmia, usually premature  ventricular beats or contractions (PVB) or mitral  valve prolapse, which usually do not require treat- ment; if severe, these may require further diagnosis  or treatment. If palpitation episodes are brief, they  are probably within the range of normal. Rarely,  some medications can produce palpitations from  PVBs. Some cases of mitral valve prolapse require  treatment. Persistent palpitations or tachycardia  can be evaluated by a family physician, general  internist or specialist in cardiology. Palpitations often occur during panic attacks or as  a phobic reaction to a feared stimulus. For example,  a person who is phobic about dogs may experience  palpitations just at the sight of a dog walking on the  street. Although the dog is on a leash and does not  seem aggressive, the phobic individual may experi- ence palpitations along with sweaty palms, weak  knees and dizziness. Those who experience palpitations may fear that  they are having a heart attack or that they are going  to die. Just thinking these thoughts and becoming  afraid of imagined consequences can cause the pal- pitations to increase. Symptoms of anxiety, such as palpitations, are  treated with behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy  and, in some cases, drug therapy. See also ANXIETY DISORDERS.

The feeling may be caused  by stress, but it also causes extreme stress in the  affected individual because it is usually accompa- nied by a fear of dying, a sense of imminent danger  or impending doom and an urge to escape. Panic attacks are considered one of several anxi- ety disorders. They can occur in a variety of anxi- ety disorders, such as panic disorder, agoraphobia,  social phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. The word panic is derived from the name “Pan,”  whom Greeks worshiped as their god of flocks,  herds, pastures and fields. Pan loved to scare people  and make eerie noises to frighten those who passed  by; the fright he aroused was known as “panic.” Diagnosing Panic Attacks To be diagnosed as a panic attack, possible organic  causes must first be ruled out. The panic incident  must include at least four or more of the charac- teristic symptoms: a sense of breathing difficulty,  palpitations or rapid heartbeat; sweating; trem- bling or shaking; feelings of smothering or choking;  chest pains, nausea or abdominal distress; dizziness'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content='partners and general stress. For some, the anxiety is  nearly always relieved somewhat in the presence of  a trusted companion, a pet or an inanimate object  such as an umbrella or shopping cart. Some agoraphobics develop ways to live more  comfortably with their disorder. For example, those  who go to churches or movie theaters may be less  frightened in an aisle seat so that they can make a  fast exit if they experience a panic attack. Having a  telephone nearby is another comfort. Many agoraphobics have episodes of depres- sion. The first episode may occur within weeks or  months of the first panic attack. Individuals com- plain of feeling “blue,” have crying spells, feel hope- less and irritable, suffer from a lack of interest in  work and have difficulty in sleeping. Agoraphobia  is often aggravated during a depressive episode. The  agoraphobia    23 001-476_mentalhealth_a-z.indd   23 9/27/07   12:33:53 PM'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 338}, page_content='of underlying emotional conflicts, such as fear of  being trapped or loss of emotional support. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  of Mental Disorders (4th ed., 1994) (DSM-IV), the  first attack typically occurs in individuals in their  late teens. Initially, attacks are unexpected and do  not occur immediately before or upon exposure  to a stressful situation, such as a simple phobia or  social phobias. Later, in the course of the disorder,  certain situations may be identified with causing a  panic attack, such as crossing a bridge or being on  an escalator. Once a panic attack has occurred in a  particular setting, the individual may become fear- ful that it will happen again and tend to avoid that  situation. Panic Attacks in Context When a health professional assesses the signifi- cance of the problem, it is important to determine  the context in which it occurs. According to DSM- IV, three characteristic types of panic attacks relate  in different ways to the onset of the attack and the  presence or absence of situational triggers: Unexpected panic attack: The onset of the attack is not  associated with any situational trigger. Situationally bound attack: The attack almost invari- ably occurs immediately upon exposure to, or in  anticipation of, the stressful situational trigger. Situationally predisposed panic attack: More likely to  occur upon exposure to the situational cue or  trigger, but it is not invariably associated with  the cue and does not necessarily occur immedi- ately after exposure to the stressful factor. Panic Disorder When panic attacks recur frequently and disrupt  an individual’s life, the condition is known as panic  disorder. Sufferers (1 to 2 percent of the popula- tion) may have attacks ranging from two or three  a day to two to four times a week. This type of dis- order tends to run a fluctuating course and wors- ens when the individual comes under stress. Panic  disorder usually begins during periods of choices,  transitions, separation and added responsibilities.  There is often a family history of panic disorder. For  example, first-degree relatives of patients with panic  disorder are at a markedly higher risk of developing  the disorder (15 to 20 percent compared to 1 per- cent in the general population). In diagnosing panic disorder, the essential fea- ture is the presence of recurrent, unexpected panic  attacks followed by at least one month of persistent  concern about having another panic attack, worry  about the possible implications or consequence  of the attacks or a significant behavioral change  related to the attacks. Personality Characteristics Personality characteristics of those who have panic  disorder vary considerably. However, H. Michael  Zal, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Philadel- phia College of Osteopathic Medicine, has observed  some common factors. Additionally, cross-sectional  studies of persons with panic disorder or agora- phobia have demonstrated personality traits of  dependency, avoidance, low self-esteem and inter- personal sensitivity. One common attribute shared  by panic-prone people includes placing a great  value on control. Any loss or threatened loss of  control, particularly in changes in their lifestyles,  causes them to feel anxious and stressed. According  to Dr. Zal, panic-prone people overvalue their inde- pendence and feel great discomfort in acknowledg- ing their dependencies. They are often reluctant  to accept help and prefer to help others. Known  to repress feelings, they feel anxious when their  emotions surface. As perfectionists and compulsive  individuals, they have high expectations of them- selves and others.

Treatment begins with education about the illness  and encouragement to reenter those situations that  the person has come to avoid. Cognitive therapy  (changing how they think and dealing with their  feeling of anxiety) helps for some individuals. For  others, behavior therapy (changing how they act in  response to certain situations and using desensitiza- tion techniques to gradually expose sufferers to the  situations they have avoided) is useful. During the late 1990s, alprazolam (trade name:  Xanax) was the first medication approved in the  United States for panic disorder. Previously, vari- ous studies indicated that tricyclic antidepressant  drugs (such as imipramine) provided an effective,  safe treatment for panic disorder. However, those  medications typically take three to six weeks for  noticeable improvement, and side effects, including  anxiety symptoms, occur in up to one-third of the  patients. The SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitors), such as Zoloft and Prozac have been  found useful for long-term prevention of panic  attacks. Three-quarters of patients who have to take  drugs will need long-term drug therapy, while  another 25 percent will not be helped regardless of  how long they take drugs. Overall, a quarter of the  patients who do take drugs are helped permanently  and will not have to continue with medication. How Family Members Can Help Panic  Disorder Sufferers Treatment for panic disorder is not limited to medi- cal or psychotherapeutic intervention. Family mem- bers can help in recognizing panic disorders by being  alert to the individual’s level of anxiety. Because  symptoms can be hidden, repeated avoidance of  situations is often the best clue. Family members  can give the sufferer support, be good listeners and  talk openly and constructively among each other.  Instead of enabling the person to avoid a situation,  family members can help him or her make a small  step forward by finding something positive in that  effort. Most important, family members should be  patient and accepting and not sacrifice their own  lives nor build resentment toward the sufferer.

For example, a para- noid person may question loyalty of employees or  friends. In new situations, a paranoid individual  may read hidden meanings into remarks or events.  These individuals are quick to anger and are reluc- tant to confide in others because they fear that  information may be used against them. Many normally healthy individuals have para- noid tendencies at certain times and under certain  circumstances, some of which may be warranted.  However, when carried to extreme, paranoid ten- dencies are considered paranoid personality disor- der. This term is applied to persistent, nonbizarre  delusions that are not due to any other mental dis- order, such as schizophrenia or a mood disorder.  Common types of delusions are erotomanic, gran- diose, jealous and persecutory. Erotomanic delu- sions are that one is loved by another, usually a  famous or important person.

Treatment Treatment is usually targeted toward several  aspects of the agoraphobic syndrome: agoraphobia,  panic attacks and anticipatory anxiety. A variety  of treatments are used, sometimes in sequence or  in combination. Treatment of agoraphobia is more  complicated than treatment of simple phobias  because panic attacks themselves seem to be the  basis of the disorder. Many treatments are based on exposure therapy.  A major component of treatment involves exposing  the agoraphobic to situations that are commonly  avoided and frightening in order to demonstrate  that there is no actual danger. Treatment may  include direct exposure, such as having the individ- ual walk or drive away from a safe place or a safe  person or enter a crowded shopping center. Indi- rect exposure is also used; this may involve use of  films with fear-arousing cues. Systematic desensiti- zation is included in this category, as this procedure  is characterized by exposure (either in imagination  or in vivo) to the least reactive elements of a situ- ation or object until the anxiety response no lon- ger occurs. Then a slightly more reactive element  or item is presented and so on until the individual  can be exposed to the most critical aspect without  a strong anxiety response. Another imaginal proce- dure for anxiety treatment includes flooding or con- tinuous presentation of the most reactive elements  of a situation until anxiety reduction occurs. Behavior therapy is used to treat many agora- phobics. This includes educating individuals about  their reactions to anxiety-producing situations,  explaining the physiology and genetics involved  (where applicable) and teaching breathing exer- cises to help overcome hyperventilation. In many  cases, three to six months of behavior therapy is  effective, and subsequent supportive and behav- ioral techniques reduce the anxiety level and help  individuals master their fear of recurrent attacks in  specific situations. Also known as in vivo therapy, exposure ther- apy uses real-life exposure to the threat. Facing the  fearful situation with appropriate reinforcement  may help an individual undo the learned fear.  Some therapists set specific goals for the sufferer for  each week, such as walking one block from home,  then two and three, taking a bus and progressing  after each session. Particularly in the early stages of  treatment, many therapists accompany agorapho- bic individuals as they venture into public places. In  some cases, spouses or family members are trained  to accompany the agoraphobic individual; other  therapists recommend structured group therapy  with defined goals and social skill training for the  agoraphobic and their families. Psychotherapy With psychotherapy, agoraphobics learn to resolve  past conflicts that may have contributed to their  agoraphobic state. Psychotherapy is often used  in conjunction with an attempt to relieve symp- toms with behavioral therapies and possibly drug  therapy. Drug Therapy The treatment of choice today for agoraphobia  involves the use of behavioral exposure therapy and  careful use of medication, with the latter withdrawn  as progress is made in behavioral therapy. Particu- larly for those who have panic attacks, drug therapy  initially seems to enhance results of  exposure- based treatments. In many cases, drugs are used for  three to six months and then discontinued once the  individual has some control over bodily sensations.  Some individuals never experience recurrence of  attacks, while attacks return months or years later  for others. When attacks recur, a second course of  drug therapy is often successful. A variety of drugs are used in the treatment of  panic attacks associated with agoraphobia. These  include the tricyclic antidepressants and the MAOIs  (which are also used to treat severe depression) and  alprazolam, an antianxiety drug.

The  therapist can help members of the family recognize  and cope with the range of emotions they feel, and  when needed, help them improve their communi- cation skills and learn techniques for parenting and  stress management. A newer technique for PTSD involves “rap”  groups, in which survivors of similar traumatic events  are encouraged to share their experiences and reac- tions. Group members help each other realize that  many people have gone through and experienced  similar events and emotions. Over time, the mem- bers gain an improved self-image and self-esteem.  Antidepressant medications have also been reported  to reverse symptoms of PTSD. Selective serotonin  reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been found effec- tive in reducing anxiety symptoms. The new atypi- cal antipsychotic medications are helpful in reducing  the fearful dreams, flashbacks, hallucinations and  issues of irritability that sometimes occur. In 2006, during the American military inter- vention in Iraq, just as after the Vietnam War and  the Gulf War in the early 1990s, many veterans  returned home with identifiable PTSD symptoms.  Many experienced severe problems upon their  return that subsided within a few months. For  many, concerns persisted, such as fear and anxiety;  certain triggers that can cause anxiety may include  certain noises or smells. Many re-experienced the  trauma of their battle with insurgents and had  unwanted thoughts of the trauma with flashbacks  or very vivid images, as if the trauma were happen- ing again. Flashbacks may make the veteran feel  a loss of control. Nightmares may occur. Veterans  may be impatient or irritable, for no apparent rea- son. They may avoid situations that remind them of  the terrain in Iraq or other places. Family relation- ships may suffer. They may increase their use of  drugs or alcohol. They may also feel guilt or shame  for surviving when their friends did not.

Symptoms might include  dizziness, backache, tiredness, general weakness,  insomnia, frequent dreams and sexual dysfunction.  The sexual dysfunction symptoms (premature ejac- ulation and impotence) are attributed to excessive  semen loss from frequent intercourse, masturba- tion, nocturnal emission or passing of “white urine”  believed to contain semen.

The break in circadian rhythm can  affect mental ability, alertness and temperament.  Some night-shift workers experience anxiety and  lapses in memory as a result of sleep deprivation.  Coping mechanisms to combat fatigue, and later to  induce sleep, may include overeating, alcohol con- sumption and use of sedatives and stimulants. Social needs of night-shift workers are a consid- eration. For example, the rest of the world oper- ates on a 9 to 5 schedule, with most socialization  occurring after work and on weekends.

PTSD has been referred to as battle fatigue or shell  shock when caused by military combat. Often PTSD surfaces several months or even  years later, although its symptoms can occur soon  after the event. Sufferers characteristically reexpe- rience the trauma in painful recollections or recur- rent dreams or nightmares. Some have diminished  emotional responsiveness (“numbing”), feelings  of estrangement from others, insomnia, disturbed  sleep, difficulty in concentrating or remembering,  guilt about surviving when others did not, avoid- ance of activities that cause recollection of the trau- matic event and intensive thoughts related to the  event. Avoidance behavior also affects sufferers’  relationships because they often avoid close emo- tional ties with family, colleagues and friends. Sometimes the reexperience comes as a sud- den, painful rush of emotions that seem to have  no cause. These emotions may be anger or intense  fear; some PTSD sufferers endure anxiety and panic  attacks. During panic attacks, their throats tighten,  breathing and heart rate increase, and they may  feel dizzy and nauseous.

Once the decision for involvement has been made,  they may face the stress of being questioned by the  police, exposed to threats or harassment from the  associates or family of the criminal and harried by  postponement and rescheduling of the trial with no  regard for their work schedule and other personal  responsibilities. A decision not to become involved is often  made. These people may feel that there are other  witnesses to the crime, and they want to avoid a  difficult and personally dangerous situation. Some  of them may later feel the guilt of doing nothing,  and they will experience extreme stress. Watching a violent crime may also result in PTSD  with symptoms of anxiety, nightmares, insomnia  and other fears. Recovery can be aided with a vari- ety of psychotherapies administered by profession- als. Victim/Witness Assistance Programs, whose  services include psychological counseling, have  been initiated in some areas of the United States.  During the trial, program administrators may make  arrangements for witnesses to get in and out of  court buildings with minimum public and media  exposure, as well as intervene to the court on behalf  of the witness when he or she is a victim of stressful  threats or intimidation. Overcoming PTSD Individuals who have PTSD can learn to work  through the trauma and pain and to resolve their  anxieties. Individual psychotherapy is one of many  useful therapies. PTSD results, in part, from the dif- ference between the individual’s personal values  and the reality of what he or she witnessed or expe- rienced during the traumatic event. Psychotherapy  helps the individual examine his or her values and  behavior, with the goal of resolving the conscious  and unconscious conflicts that were created. Addi- tionally, the individual works to build self-esteem'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 60}, page_content='agoraphobic individuals have panic attacks, while  others do not. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) About 3.3 million American adults ages 18 to 54  or about 2.3 percent of people in this age group  in a given year, have obsessive-compulsive disor- der (OCD). The first symptoms of OCD often begin  during childhood or adolescence. Individuals with  OCD go through repeated, involuntary ritualis- tic behaviors in the belief that they are prevent- ing an unwanted future event. For example, those  who worry about infection may develop compul- sive hand-washing habits. Hand washing affects  more women than men. Compulsives also check  and recheck that doors are locked or that electric  switches and ovens are turned off. The check- ing compulsion seems to affect more men than  women. Obsessions are repeated, unwanted thoughts,  which can last for seconds or hours. The most com- mon obsessions focus on hurting others or violating  socially acceptable behavioral standards, such as  swearing or making inappropriate sexual advances.  For some individuals they are focused on religious  or philosophical issues. Compulsive behaviors are rituals that get out of  control. For many people, obsessions begin as cop- ing mechanisms for overcoming anxieties. People  who experience obsessive disorders do not auto- matically have compulsive behaviors. However,  most people who have compulsive, ritual behaviors  also suffer from obsessions. Obsessive-compulsive disorders often begin dur- ing the teens or early adulthood. Generally they  are chronic and cause moderate to severe disability.  People who have obsessive-compulsive disorders  usually have involuntary, recurrent and persistent  thoughts or impulses that are distasteful to them. Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently  occurs after violent personal assaults such as rape,  mugging or domestic violence; terrorism; natural  or human-caused disasters and accidents. Approxi- mately 5.2 million American adults ages 18 to 54,  or about 3.6 percent of people in this age group in  a given year, have PTSD, according to the National  Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Results from an  NIMH-supported survey showed that female risk of  developing PTSD following trauma is twice that of  males. PTSD can develop at any age, including child- hood. About 30 percent of Vietnam veterans expe- rienced PTSD at some point after the war. PTSD is  characterized by persistent symptoms of fear that  occur after experiencing a traumatic event. Night- mares, flashbacks, numbing of emotions, depres- sion and feeling angry, irritable, or distracted and  being easily startled are common. Females are  more likely to develop long-term PTSD than males  and have higher rates of co-occurring medical and  psychiatric problems than males with the disorder.  PTSD involves avoidance of thoughts, feelings, situ- ations or activities that are associated with a shock- ing or painful experience in the individual’s past.  This can affect anyone who has survived a severe  physical or mental trauma. It is now known that PTSD can affect children as  well as adults. For example, children who have wit- nessed a shooting in a school or restaurant or vio- lence in the streets suffer symptoms similar to those  of adults who have been through wars, witnessed  airplane collisions or been physically attacked. The  severity of the disorder seems to increase when the  trauma is unanticipated. For that reason, not all  war veterans develop post-traumatic stress disor- der, despite prolonged and brutal combat, because  soldiers expect a certain amount of violence,  whereas rape victims may be especially affected by  the unexpectedness of the attack. Individuals who suffer from PTSD re-experience  the traumatizing event through flashbacks of the  event, dreams or nightmares.

Many veterans of the war in Iraq,  which began in 2003, suffer from PTSD and are  receiving treatment to overcome their flashbacks,  depression, nightmares, and feelings of constant  vigilance. Along with shared anxieties, many people  have their own private mental health concerns.  Depression hits more than 1 9 million U.S. adults  each year. Of those, 12 million are women. About  one in eight U.S. women will be diagnosed with  depression during her lifetime. Depression is a  leading cause of drug and alcohol use. Drug and  alcohol addictions continue to incur huge costs for  society, such as emergency medical care crime,  corrections, law enforcement, lost productivity,  education, treatment and prevention. Sleep diffi- culties resulted in 45 million prescriptions being  written for sleep medications in 2005. Many peo- ple manage their anxieties by overeating or smok- ing. In the long run, unhealthy ways of coping take  their toll on physical as well as mental health. Research in the area of therapies for many var- ied mental health issues is ongoing. In the last few  years, the professional community has given much  attention to the use of medications known as atyp- ical antidepressants. Many of these new pharma- ceutical tools have been approved and have been  useful for some people. Another area of ongoing research involves  determining a definition of happiness and how  various people interpret happiness. Happiness  can be defined as a lasting state of mind charac- terized by contentment and acceptance as well  as engagement in life’s experiences with peri- o ds  o f  j o yfuln e s s  an d  a p p r e cia ti o n  as  o p p o s e d  t o   immediate pleasures. Happiness is very difficult  to attain without good mental health and matu- rity, but even then it requires conscious attention.  It is attainable through developing the capacity to  see beyond moments of disappointment and hurt,  beyond the mundane experience of living, and  to appreciate life’s beauty, the miracle of human  consciousness and life itself. Depression, anxieties,  addictive behaviors and severe physical pain make  it difficult to attain happiness by interfering with  the ability to see beyond one’s immediate negative  experience.

(1878–1958) An American  psychologist and founder of behaviorism. Wat- son wrote, “Psychology as the behaviorist views  it is a purely objective branch of natural science.  Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of  behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of  its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data  dependent upon the readiness with which they  lend themselves to interpretation in terms of con- sciousness.” Watson emphasized learned behavior,  stimulus-response connections and conditioning,  and he regarded behavior as the product of both  heredity and the environment. He believed that the  task of psychology is to determine what is instinc- tive and what is learned. Watson is best known for  his article “Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It”  (1913).

Particularly for some individuals who live  alone, facing solitude creates emotional difficulties.  To overcome the dislike and fear of being alone,  as well as the change in mood from the workweek  when one is surrounded by people, individuals  may schedule pleasurable activities with friends or  like-minded others so that they will not spend the  entire weekend alone. Weekend depression should  be distinguished from chronic depression.

For good  mental health, individuals have a need for positive  self-regard, much of which comes from approval  (or disapproval) from significant others. When good  habits are praised and rewarded, they are rein- forced; when bad habits are ignored and rewards  are withheld or punished (negative reinforcement),  presumably they will diminish. In daily life as well  as in therapy, individuals can be motivated to  change behavior patterns to include more adaptive  responses and more socially acceptable behaviors.  Methods of reinforcement may include rewards  such as privileges or increased social interactions.  There is evidence suggesting that in humans posi- tive reinforcement works better than negative rein- forcement to change behavior. relationships Relationships are formed between  individuals connected by affinity. These relation- ships include the individual’s family, spouse, lovers,  friends and business or professional associates. Good  relationships are healthy and nurturing and act as a  buffer against stress on good mental health. How- ever, even the most meaningful relationships can at  times be nonsupportive and sources of anxiety. Relationships and Health Best friends are invaluable to good mental health. A  best friend is on the same wavelength as you; under- stands your personal situations, such as dealing with  a difficult boss or overbearing parent; appreciates  and admires who you are, even if there is not always  agreement on what is being done or said; makes you  feel important in his or her life; is very much like  you and has the same values and belief systems. People who lack outlets for anxiety release are  susceptible to a list of anxiety-related illnesses.  Having one or two close friends with whom they  feel free to say anything is invaluable. When they  are overwhelmed, they do not trust their own  judgment, and an objective view from a friend can  help. Romantic Relationships Romantic relationships are far riskier and poten- tially more anxiety producing to the individual’s  emotional and physical well-being than people  realize. Not only are feelings likely to be hurt, self- esteem damaged and trust betrayed, but there can  be physical and mental battery by an outraged  spouse. America’s high divorce rate suggests that  intimacy has painful consequences. According to Geraldine K. Piorkowski, author of  Too Close for Comfort: Exploring the Risks of Intimacy,  romantic relationships can produce anxiety because  they are related to the process of getting close to  another person. As we become more intimate (both  emotionally and sexually), we reveal our deepest  secrets, hopes, inadequacies and even fantasies.  We become more vulnerable, and thus easily cut  to the core by a hostile comment, act of betrayal or  moment of rejection. Furthermore, Piorkowski says, anxiety arises  in relationships when our emotional needs and  expectations are unrealistic. Also, we may lose our  autonomy and wind up feeling suffocated by the  other’s demands; their neediness may drain energy  needed to pursue our own desires and interests. We  may be blamed for all the problems in the relation- ship and suffer guilt and loss of self-confidence as  a result. Relationships and Support Groups A lack of connections with other people can be det- rimental to good mental health, says Dr. Andrew  Weil, author of Spontaneous Healing. “Surrounding  yourself with supportive people is an important  step for any healing you need to do. Whenever I  take a family history from a patient, I always ask  about people who are helping or hindering some- one’s illness. For example, sometimes a friend or  family member who means well only make matters  worse, maybe by not wanting the patient to express  relationships    371 HOW A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP CAN CONTRIBUTE TO  BETTER MENTAL HEALTH \\x81 realism: openness and honesty with each other \\x81 trust: allowing the individuals to share their feelings'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 379}, page_content='relationships    371 HOW A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP CAN CONTRIBUTE TO  BETTER MENTAL HEALTH \\x81 realism: openness and honesty with each other \\x81 trust: allowing the individuals to share their feelings \\x81 true friendship: having no hidden motives \\x81 forgiveness: accepting the individual as he or she is \\x81  security: knowing that individuals can count on one  another \\x81  vulnerability: exposing weaknesses that allow the  relationship to grow 001-476_mentalhealth_a-z.indd   371 9/27/07   12:34:50 PM'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 472}, page_content='464 vacations According to Emrika Padus in The Com- plete Guide to Your Emotions and Your Health  (Rodale  Press, 1992), “getting away from it all—breaking  free from routine—can bring a new perspective  to old dilemmas and put a positive charge in your  mental outlook. You’ll get to know yourself a little  better. And when you come home, you’ll be hap- pier, healthier and much more effective in coping  with stress.” The book offers many healthy reasons for taking  a vacation; Edward Heath, Ph.D., professor in the  department of Recreation and Parks, Texas A&M  University, and Richard I. Curtis, author of Taking  Off (Harmony Books, 1981) concur. These reasons  include: Getting away from the daily routine Relaxing Seeing new sights Opening up to different experiences Making new friends Sharing an event Learning new skills Participating in an adventure Enjoying beauty Anticipating pleasure Remembering the joy Said Dr. Heath, “The major goal of a vacation  is happiness. You leave your troubles behind you  . . . return refreshed and renewed. You should like  your life a little better after a vacation.” However, vacations do not always result in bet- ter mental health. Vacations themselves can add to  one’s stress load. First there is the choice of how  to travel—by car, train, ship or plane. Dealing with  reservations can produce anxious feelings. Packing  and preparing those left behind, in the case of fami- lies, can be difficult, especially when parents leave  young children. When grandparents take on the  responsibilities of caring for the children, intergen- erational conflicts may result. Delays of trains and planes, missed connections,  and accommodations not up to one’s expectations  can be stressful. Bad weather can do more than  dampen one’s spirits; weather affects the enjoy- ment level of many sites. Additionally, interper- sonal relationships are really put to the test on  vacations, as friends, couples or other groupings are  in close quarters and together every day. See also HOBBIES.

Vaginismus  is one of the more common sexual dysfunctions  that women experience. It is often triggered by a  distasteful or painful early sexual problem such  as rape or being the victim of sexual molestation.  It can also be caused by physical problems such  as chronic vaginitis or an imperforate hymen. At  times vaginismus treatment requires intensive psy- chotherapy to search into its causes; in other cases,  simply correcting a physical problem will alleviate  vaginismus. Behavioral modification techniques  have proven highly successful in treatment, based  on a woman and her partner practicing stretching  the vaginal opening, often with vaginal dilators.

For example, an employee with two years on  the job may only receive 20 percent of the contri- butions into his or her retirement fund. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that many  job switchers do not properly transfer employer- retirement savings when switching jobs. One recent  poll found that more than two-thirds of job chang- ers take cash payouts on their 401k plans, which,  when withdrawn before the age of 59½, result in as  much as a 40 percent loss in one’s nest egg due to  penalty fees and taxes.

Then, many employers had implicit or  explicit long-term employment contracts with their  workers, contracts that emphasized management’s  commitment and pledge to minimize the need for  layoffs. Wages and job benefits increased over the  years, and it was not unusual for the company to pay  the total cost of employees’ health care and charge  minimally for family coverage. This job security led  workers to expect to remain in their jobs for many  years; it was not unusual for workers to devote their  entire working lives to one company, retiring with  the traditional gold watch and company pension. During the later 1990s and 2000s downsizing,  layoffs, mergers and other organizational changes  have greatly altered the job security picture.  Employers are no longer sharing their wealth; raises  and employee benefits have been scaled back. Full- time jobs are harder to find.

Writing can put the individual close to  or further from his concerns. Writing and reading  what has been written sometimes exposes one’s  subconscious, suppressed feelings that can be dealt  with more constructively when they are recognized.  In this sense a diarist may get closer to himself and  better understand self-motivations. Some mental health professionals say that  symptoms such as anxiety, depression and apa- thy are actually masks for envy, jealousy and rage  turned inward at the self. Writing may help to get  to the core of such feelings by bringing some of the  repressed thoughts and attitudes into the open and  eliminating some of the restrictions that sap energy  and limit productivity. Some diarists have found it  useful to write a portrait of a person whom they  envy or who has angered them. The portrait some- times reveals qualities of their own (which they  see in the other person) that they wish to either  develop or change. The cathartic effect of writing involves a distanc- ing from negative feelings and experiences. Once the  feelings or experiences are described on paper, the  writer frequently has a sense of being rid of them,  of being ready to go on to something else. Simply  the act of writing may also give a sense of con- trol, a way of giving some order and manageability  to problems. List making in a diary has also been  found to be a good way of setting goals and giving  order to what may seem to be an enormous or cha- otic task. Keeping a journal has also been useful for  the person who is attempting to control addictive  or obsessive behavior. The diary not only improves  self- understanding and serves as a way to record  progress but also gives the individual something she  can refer to when she wants a drink or a cigarette or'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 192}, page_content='then heightens the probability of aggression toward  the new and more proximate source.

According to Jeff Zwiefel, M.S.,  Director, The National Exercise for Life Institute,  physical strength and stamina and a confident atti- tude are the main by-products of exercise. A study  at Baruch College, New York, found that people  who are stronger and more muscularly fit have a  significantly better self-image than their peers. Psy- chological tests have discovered that those who  exercise are more confident, emotionally stable and  outgoing than those who are sedentary. Joan C. Gondola, associate professor of physical  education at Baruch College, found the same posi- tive results of exercise on creativity levels when she  administered a test on female college students. One  group had exercised 20 minutes before the tests  and the other group had not; the exercise group  had more imaginative responses than those that  had not. The boost in creativity may be attributed to the  release of adrenaline and endorphins during exer- cise. The right side of the brain is stimulated by  these chemicals, which control creative and intui- tive processes. Exercise is an excellent way to relieve stress,  whether caused by pressures at work, family ten- sions or grief. However, exercise may also become  a compulsion, when the individual drops other  responsibilities in favor of improving body image or  losing weight. Because of our society’s emphasis on  a thin, slender body shape, many individuals have  become exercise addicts. For some individuals, such  addiction interferes with their mental well-being.  An example is compulsive exercise that accompa- nies eating disorders. See BODY IMAGE; RESOURCES. experiential family therapy A type of family ther- apy emphasizing experiences between family mem- bers and between family members and therapist  during therapy. The therapy is based on humanistic  approaches that focus on helping family members  learn to use symptoms and anxieties constructively.  It is also known as symbolic- experiential family  therapy. See also PSYCHOTHERAPIES. exposure therapy  Behavioral therapies that  emphasize changing an individual’s responses to  phobic situations while gradually increasing expo- sure to the feared situation. Exposure therapy may  be effective for some phobias and for agoraphobia;  to be effective, appropriate drug therapy is also  used in many cases.

The system consists  of nerve pathways linking nerve nuclei in the sur- face of the cerebrum (the main mass of the brain),  the basal ganglia deep within the brain and parts of  the brain stem. Degeneration of or damage to parts  of the system can cause disturbances in execution  of voluntary (willful) movements and in muscle  tone and can cause the appearance of involuntary  (unwanted) movements such as tremors or writh- ing motions. Disturbances of this type occur in  Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and some  types of cerebral palsy. Extrapyramidal side effects can also occur as a  result of taking some phenothiazine drugs, used for  treating some mental disorders.

Many veterans of the war in Iraq,  which began in 2003, suffer from PTSD and are  receiving treatment to overcome their flashbacks,  depression, nightmares, and feelings of constant  vigilance. Along with shared anxieties, many people  have their own private mental health concerns.  Depression hits more than 1 9 million U.S. adults  each year. Of those, 12 million are women. About  one in eight U.S. women will be diagnosed with  depression during her lifetime. Depression is a  leading cause of drug and alcohol use. Drug and  alcohol addictions continue to incur huge costs for  society, such as emergency medical care crime,  corrections, law enforcement, lost productivity,  education, treatment and prevention. Sleep diffi- culties resulted in 45 million prescriptions being  written for sleep medications in 2005. Many peo- ple manage their anxieties by overeating or smok- ing. In the long run, unhealthy ways of coping take  their toll on physical as well as mental health. Research in the area of therapies for many var- ied mental health issues is ongoing. In the last few  years, the professional community has given much  attention to the use of medications known as atyp- ical antidepressants. Many of these new pharma- ceutical tools have been approved and have been  useful for some people. Another area of ongoing research involves  determining a definition of happiness and how  various people interpret happiness. Happiness  can be defined as a lasting state of mind charac- terized by contentment and acceptance as well  as engagement in life’s experiences with peri- o ds  o f  j o yfuln e s s  an d  a p p r e cia ti o n  as  o p p o s e d  t o   immediate pleasures. Happiness is very difficult  to attain without good mental health and matu- rity, but even then it requires conscious attention.  It is attainable through developing the capacity to  see beyond moments of disappointment and hurt,  beyond the mundane experience of living, and  to appreciate life’s beauty, the miracle of human  consciousness and life itself. Depression, anxieties,  addictive behaviors and severe physical pain make  it difficult to attain happiness by interfering with  the ability to see beyond one’s immediate negative  experience.

People want to feel that they can rely on  their friends and that their friends will be open and  honest with them. Friendships are involved in maintaining good  mental health. Friendships can be supportive in our  daily lives as well as during periods of turmoil or  crisis. Individuals who experience depression often  report a lack of friends, although having a wide cir- cle of friends is not a preventive factor for depres- sion. Some reports have indicated that individuals  who have many social contacts may be healthier  and actually live longer than those who do not. Friendships also affect mental health because  they may challenge or be challenged by other rela- tionships in contemporary life. For example, an  employer, supervisor or teacher, particularly one  with an authoritarian personality, may feel that  friendships among students or employees give them  too much power as a group. In the workplace, a  friendship may dissolve when one is promoted and  the other stays behind. A friendship may be broken  or changed when one friend marries, and disrup- tive friendships can weaken a marriage. A friend of  the opposite sex is frequently unsettling to a spouse  or lover. Friends who do not meet with parents’  approval can also be a source of family conflict.  Friends who decide to share housing or enter into a  business partnership sometimes learn about unde- sirable qualities of the other that could be ignored  when the relationship was less formal. The freedom inherent in friendship has its nega- tive as well as positive aspects. There are fewer social  rules about friendship than other relationships, and  two people may have entirely different expectations  from each other until those expectations clash. The  lack of structure for friendships may also allow one  friend to take the other for granted until the friend- ship disintegrates. Among early humans, friendship was a band- ing together to avoid danger. In contemporary life,  friendship may again play a role in combating the  physical and psychological dangers of high crime  and anonymity of modern urban life. The nuclear family of modern life puts increas- ing pressures on family members to be one anoth- er’s friends. Parents and children, husbands and  wives who, in the past, may have had a network  of relatives and longtime friends now turn to their  immediate family for friendship, not always with  satisfactory results. A Gallup poll reported in 1990 showed that  the typical American places much importance on  friendship and indicates some frustrations that peo- ple have in forming friendships. Friendship requires  time and a certain degree of flexibility. Twenty-five  percent of the total surveyed said that they did not  have enough time to spend with friends, and 46  percent of those who said they would like to have  more friends indicated, almost in contradiction,  that they did not have enough time to spend with  the friends they had. Working women and couples  with children at home were most likely to feel that  they had insufficient time to spend with friends. The survey showed that women and men approach  friendship quite differently. Women tended to form  more intimate relationships with other women than  men with men. One to one activities that promote  conversation are more popular with women, whereas  men are more likely to get together in groups for  activities such as sports or cards. Men rely on their  wives for emotional support rather than other men;  but many women, even those who are married, often  rely on other women. Women are more likely than  men to have a best friend of the same sex. Almost a  third of the men surveyed said a woman was their  best friend. When participants were asked about arguments  with friends, those under age 30 reported more dis- agreements.

For good  mental health, individuals have a need for positive  self-regard, much of which comes from approval  (or disapproval) from significant others. When good  habits are praised and rewarded, they are rein- forced; when bad habits are ignored and rewards  are withheld or punished (negative reinforcement),  presumably they will diminish. In daily life as well  as in therapy, individuals can be motivated to  change behavior patterns to include more adaptive  responses and more socially acceptable behaviors.  Methods of reinforcement may include rewards  such as privileges or increased social interactions.  There is evidence suggesting that in humans posi- tive reinforcement works better than negative rein- forcement to change behavior. relationships Relationships are formed between  individuals connected by affinity. These relation- ships include the individual’s family, spouse, lovers,  friends and business or professional associates. Good  relationships are healthy and nurturing and act as a  buffer against stress on good mental health. How- ever, even the most meaningful relationships can at  times be nonsupportive and sources of anxiety. Relationships and Health Best friends are invaluable to good mental health. A  best friend is on the same wavelength as you; under- stands your personal situations, such as dealing with  a difficult boss or overbearing parent; appreciates  and admires who you are, even if there is not always  agreement on what is being done or said; makes you  feel important in his or her life; is very much like  you and has the same values and belief systems. People who lack outlets for anxiety release are  susceptible to a list of anxiety-related illnesses.  Having one or two close friends with whom they  feel free to say anything is invaluable. When they  are overwhelmed, they do not trust their own  judgment, and an objective view from a friend can  help. Romantic Relationships Romantic relationships are far riskier and poten- tially more anxiety producing to the individual’s  emotional and physical well-being than people  realize. Not only are feelings likely to be hurt, self- esteem damaged and trust betrayed, but there can  be physical and mental battery by an outraged  spouse. America’s high divorce rate suggests that  intimacy has painful consequences. According to Geraldine K. Piorkowski, author of  Too Close for Comfort: Exploring the Risks of Intimacy,  romantic relationships can produce anxiety because  they are related to the process of getting close to  another person. As we become more intimate (both  emotionally and sexually), we reveal our deepest  secrets, hopes, inadequacies and even fantasies.  We become more vulnerable, and thus easily cut  to the core by a hostile comment, act of betrayal or  moment of rejection. Furthermore, Piorkowski says, anxiety arises  in relationships when our emotional needs and  expectations are unrealistic. Also, we may lose our  autonomy and wind up feeling suffocated by the  other’s demands; their neediness may drain energy  needed to pursue our own desires and interests. We  may be blamed for all the problems in the relation- ship and suffer guilt and loss of self-confidence as  a result. Relationships and Support Groups A lack of connections with other people can be det- rimental to good mental health, says Dr. Andrew  Weil, author of Spontaneous Healing. “Surrounding  yourself with supportive people is an important  step for any healing you need to do. Whenever I  take a family history from a patient, I always ask  about people who are helping or hindering some- one’s illness. For example, sometimes a friend or  family member who means well only make matters  worse, maybe by not wanting the patient to express  relationships    371 HOW A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP CAN CONTRIBUTE TO  BETTER MENTAL HEALTH \\x81 realism: openness and honesty with each other \\x81 trust: allowing the individuals to share their feelings'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/6.pdf.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='iv M ental health is a continuum, ranging from  the annoyances of stressful random nui- sances to serious mental disorders. W e hope that  readers will find this third edition of The Encyclo- pedia of Mental Health helpful while coping with  everyday challenges in healthy ways. According to Healthy People 2010,  published by  the U.S. government, mental health is a state of  successful mental functioning, resulting in pro- ductive activities, fulfilling relationships, and the  ability to adapt to change and cope with adversity.  This blueprint for good health indicates that men- tal health is indispensable to well-being, family  and interpersonal relationships, and one’s contri- bution to society. Much has changed in the world since the sec- ond edition of T h e  E n c y c l o p e d i a  o f  M e n t a l  H e a l t h  appeared in 2001. Many entries in this third edi- tion reflect the current state of our global soci- ety. Our goal while compiling this edition was to  cover many contemporary and disparate concepts,  including those of aging, technological advance- ments, employment, the economy, war, terrorism,  personal security and acts of nature such as hurri- canes and tsunamis that have profound effects on  mental health as well as some new therapies. Older people today have increased health  expectancies, compared with Americans even  10 years ago, according to the National Institute  on Aging. That means that people over the age of  65 have fewer physical, and, with good luck, also  fewer mental health concerns. A major issue for  the aging population is the decline in mental fac- ulties; promising research is ongoing in the areas  of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Research is  essential: In 1900 there were 120,000 Americans  over age 85. Now there are more than 4 million,  and this is the fastest growing age group in the  United States. Federal officials estimate that by the  year 2030 there will be 72 million, meaning that  20 percent of the American population will be over  age 65. Baby boomers are beginning to turn 65. Now  those born between 1946 and 1960 account for 42  percent of U.S. households. These individuals have  come though periods of very rapid social change,  particularly in the last decade. Change, by itself,  whether for good or not, can be a source of stress  and can influence mental health. Technological  changes, for example, continue at an accelerat- ing pace. Instantaneous communication by cell  phones, including those that transmit pictures, and  Internet access are helpful on a daily basis to many  people but a stressful challenge to some others. As people age, the job market changes. Some  people are forced into earlier retirement than they  had planned. Jobs are no longer for life. Mergers and  layoffs have caused job insecurity across the board,  and in many cases older workers are the first to go  and face an insecure future. Working people also  face increasing threats to good mental health due  to fast-moving worldwide advancements in com- munications and technology. Effective adjustment  strategies are necessary. Recognition of the impact  of mental health on the economy is essential. The shifting global economy causes psychologi- cal uncertainties for many. Many workers are laid  off from jobs they have held for many years.

Many veterans of the war in Iraq,  which began in 2003, suffer from PTSD and are  receiving treatment to overcome their flashbacks,  depression, nightmares, and feelings of constant  vigilance. Along with shared anxieties, many people  have their own private mental health concerns.  Depression hits more than 1 9 million U.S. adults  each year. Of those, 12 million are women. About  one in eight U.S. women will be diagnosed with  depression during her lifetime. Depression is a  leading cause of drug and alcohol use. Drug and  alcohol addictions continue to incur huge costs for  society, such as emergency medical care crime,  corrections, law enforcement, lost productivity,  education, treatment and prevention. Sleep diffi- culties resulted in 45 million prescriptions being  written for sleep medications in 2005. Many peo- ple manage their anxieties by overeating or smok- ing. In the long run, unhealthy ways of coping take  their toll on physical as well as mental health. Research in the area of therapies for many var- ied mental health issues is ongoing. In the last few  years, the professional community has given much  attention to the use of medications known as atyp- ical antidepressants. Many of these new pharma- ceutical tools have been approved and have been  useful for some people. Another area of ongoing research involves  determining a definition of happiness and how  various people interpret happiness. Happiness  can be defined as a lasting state of mind charac- terized by contentment and acceptance as well  as engagement in life’s experiences with peri- o ds  o f  j o yfuln e s s  an d  a p p r e cia ti o n  as  o p p o s e d  t o   immediate pleasures. Happiness is very difficult  to attain without good mental health and matu- rity, but even then it requires conscious attention.  It is attainable through developing the capacity to  see beyond moments of disappointment and hurt,  beyond the mundane experience of living, and  to appreciate life’s beauty, the miracle of human  consciousness and life itself. Depression, anxieties,  addictive behaviors and severe physical pain make  it difficult to attain happiness by interfering with  the ability to see beyond one’s immediate negative  experience.

As the minor- ity groups become more populous, they continue to  experience inequality of income and of economic  opportunities. They face a social and economic  environment of inequality that includes greater  exposure to racism and discrimination, violence  and poverty, all of which contribute to weakening  their mental health status. Poverty greatly raises the risk of serious mental  disorders, making some minority groups particu- larly vulnerable. Blacks and Hispanics have about  triple the poverty rate of whites. African-Americans are less likely than their  white counterparts to seek treatment. When they  do seek treatment, they are more likely to use  emergency rooms for mental health care and are  more likely than whites to receive inpatient care.  About 25 percent of African-Americans do not have  health insurance, and many who do are more likely  to receive care from a primary health care provider  rather than a mental health specialist. Blacks are  overrepresented in populations at high risk for  developing mental illness, such as the homeless,  prisoners and children in foster care. For certain disorders (e.g., schizophrenia and  mood disorders) errors in diagnosis are made more  often for African Americans than for whites. How- ever, research suggests that when receiving care for  appropriate diagnoses, African Americans respond  as favorably as do whites. According to Mental Health: Culture, Race and Eth- nicity, a supplement to Mental Health: A Report of the  Surgeon General (2001), although 10 percent of U.S.  soldiers in Vietnam were black and 85 percent were  white, more black (21 percent) than white (14  percent) veterans suffer from PTSD. Investigators  attributed this difference to the greater exposure  of blacks to war-zone trauma, which increases risk  not only for PTSD but also for many health-related  and psychosocial adversities. African-American and  white veterans used Veterans’ Administration (VA)  mental health care equally, but African Americans  proved less likely to use supplemental care outside  the VA system. The rate of mental illness among Hispanics tends  to be similar to that among non-Hispanic whites.  However, Hispanic women tend to suffer from  depression more often than Hispanic men. Young  Hispanics have higher rates of depression, anxiety  disorders and suicide. The study found that His- panics born in the United States are more likely to  suffer from mental illness than are those born in  Mexico or living in Puerto Rico. Hispanics seem to  have the highest percentage (37 percent) without  any health insurance. This group also faces major  language barriers in mental health care, as commu- nication is vital for proper treatment. Few mental  health providers identify themselves as Spanish- speaking, and about four in 10 Hispanics say they  do not have strong skills in English. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are only  25 percent as likely as whites and 50 percent likely  as African Americans and Hispanics to seek outpa- tient care and are less likely than whites to receive  inpatient care. When they do seek care, they are  more likely to be misdiagnosed as “problem-free.”  Cultural stigmas associated with mental illness,  more than location, language or other barriers, stop  many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from  seeking help. Native Americans and Alaska natives appear to  suffer disproportionately from depression and sub- stance abuse and are overly represented in inpatient  care compared with whites, with the exception of  private psychiatric hospitals. American Indians  and indigenous Alaskans living in rural communi- ties have limited mental health treatment options.  These groups have a suicide rate 50 percent higher  than that of the general U.S. population.

He or she may have nightmares about separation  and physical symptoms such as stomachaches and  headaches. Social phobia usually does not affect young chil- dren but begins in the mid-teens. Typically, young  people with this disorder have a constant fear of  social or performance situations such as speaking in  class or eating in public. Along with fear, there may  be physical symptoms such as heart palpitations,  shortness of breath, blushing or sweating. Young  people with social phobia typically try to avoid the  feared situation, such as attending parties or school.  Sensitivity to criticism, difficulty being assertive  and feelings of low self-esteem are characteristics of  young people who have social phobias. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) usually  begins in early childhood or adolescence. Chil- dren with OCD have frequent and uncontrollable  thoughts or obsessions and may perform routines  or rituals compulsively in an attempt to eliminate  the thoughts. Those who have the disorder often  repeat behaviors to avoid some imagined conse- quence. Common compulsions are counting and  washing hands repeatedly. If the young person has  OCD, these obsessions and compulsions take up a  great deal of time and interfere with daily living. At  the same time, they cause anxiety for the sufferer. Post-traumatic stress disorder is experienced by  children who have been involved in a physical or  emotional trauma such as witnessing a disaster, sur- viving physical or sexual abuse or being involved in  an accident. Events that may not be traumatizing  for an adult may be traumatic for a child. The child  may “reexperience” the trauma through night- mares, constant thoughts about the event or reen- actment of the event while playing. Symptoms may  be general anxiety, irritability and trouble eating or  sleeping. Other Mental Health Concerns Eating disorders affect many young people. Anorexia  affects one in every 200 adolescent girls and a much  smaller number of boys. Approximately 1 percent  of adolescent girls develop anorexia nervosa. One  in 10 cases leads to death from starvation, cardiac  arrest, or suicide, according to the National Institute  of Mental Health. Reported cases of bulimia nervosa  vary from one to three of 100 young people. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  is the most common mental health condition affect- ing children; estimates of prevalence in childhood  range from 5 to 10 percent. However, as many as  50 percent of children with ADHD are never diag- nosed. Thirty to 40 percent of children diagnosed  with ADHD have relatives with the same type of  condition. Depression in children may take several forms.  Almost one-third of six- to 12-year-old children  diagnosed with major depression will develop bipo- lar disorder within a few years, according to the  Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adoles- cent Psychiatry. Studies show that at any given time,  as many as one in every 33 children may have clin- ical depression. Among adolescents, the rate may  be as high as one in eight. More than 20 percent  of adolescents in the general population have emo- tional problems, and one-third of adolescents who  visit psychiatric clinics suffer from depression. The juvenile justice system estimates that  between 118,700 and 186,000 youths who are  involved in the juvenile justice system have at least  one mental disorder. One study indicated that 73  percent of juveniles in justice facilities reported  having mental health problems and 57 percent  reported having prior mental health treatment  or hospitalization. According to the Department  of Justice, of the 100,000 youngsters in juvenile  detention, estimates indicate that 60 percent have  behavioral, mental or emotional problems. Suicide is an increasing concern.

It can be  affected by many factors, ranging from exogenous  stresses that are difficult to manage to biologic defects  or organic diseases that impair brain function. Many approaches have been proposed to reduce  the impact of mental health problems. Stress,  whether stemming from life events, chronic strain  or environmental pressures, is associated with bio- logic changes linked to cognitive, emotional and  behavioral dysfunctions. Healthful habits, such as  good nutrition and adequate amounts of exercise  and relaxation techniques, may be useful in help- ing to relieve stress. Because people with low levels  of control over their environment (actual or per- ceived) appear to be at greater risk, interventions  have also been directed at increasing individuals’  resources and coping skills through education and  social support. For those needing more aggressive  attention, medical interventions are available that  include use of psychotherapies, antidepressant  drugs and a variety of other techniques such as bio- feedback and meditation. Developmental delays in childhood and specific  skill disorders have also been linked to learning  and adjustment problems in adolescence and early  adulthood. Early interventions with parents and  children that address prenatal care, parental skills  and remedial help in early school programs may  help prevent developmental problems and their  progression to mental health problems. Mental Health Parity Act  (MHPA) The Mental  Health Parity Act signed into law on September 26,  1996, requires that annual or lifetime dollar lim- its on mental health benefits be no lower than any  such dollar limits for medical and surgical benefits  offered by a group health plan or health insurance  issuer offering coverage in connection with a group  health plan. The MHPA applies to most group health plans  with more than 50 workers. However, MHPA  does not apply to group health plans sponsored by  employers with fewer than 51 workers. The law does not apply to benefits for substance  abuse or chemical dependence. See also MANAGED CARE. mental illness An illness that affects or is mani- fested in a person’s brain. It may affect how the  person thinks, behaves and interacts with other  people. The term encompasses many psychiatric  disorders that vary in severity. Since the 1980s research has led to advance- ments in diagnosis and treatment of many men- tal illnesses. Where once mentally ill people were  hospitalized because they were disruptive or feared  to be harmful to themselves or others, today most  people who suffer from a mental illness, including  those disorders that can be extremely debilitating,  such as schizophrenia, can be treated effectively  and lead full lives. Mental illnesses are described and categorized in  the book Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis- orders, 4th ed., published by the American Psychiat- ric Association. Among the most commonly known  psychiatric disorders are depression, manic depres- sion, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, generalized  anxiety disorder, specific phobias, social phobia,  panic disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive  disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disor- ders (such as delusional disorder), substance abuse  and disorders related to substance abuse, delirium,  dementia (including Alzheimer’s disease), eating  disorders, sleep disorders, attention-deficit/hyper- activity disorder, learning disorders, sexual disor- ders, dissociative disorders and personality disorders  (such as borderline personality disorder and antiso- cial personality disorder). Mental illness is not a weakness or defect in  character. Mental illnesses are real illnesses that  require and respond well to treatment.

New positions  may not be available in their fields and may require  relocation and difficult retraining. Whereas older  generations in factories and office buildings were  culturally homogenous, today’s global economy  has produced a rich diversity of workers with  pronounced ethnic and cultural differences. The  stresses that arise from this diversity create unique  challenges for employers, communities and men- tal health professionals. Mental health issues vary among individuals,  cultures and types of communities. Many people  experience culture shock when they are caught  between two worlds, particularly those who tran- sition from agrarian to urbanized settings. When  workers from disparate backgrounds are placed  in new environments, mental and physical symp- toms may include anxiety and frustration, fatigue,  headaches and stomach pains. Culture shock is a  common experience; individuals and their fami- lies in a new environment may face demands and  pressures without the necessary coping skills.  Expectation may exceed reality. Practical accul- turation strategies can help minimize these effects.  Learning the language, adjusting to the norms and  values of the new society and culture, building a  social support system and promoting diversity by  understanding new neighbors’ cultural and reli- gious habits can reduce feelings of alienation and  improve self-confidence. Outsourcing labor to reduce costs may result in  workers abroad experiencing effects of isolation,  lack of social support, overwork and diminished  c o n c e r n s  f o r  i n d u s t r i a l  h y g i e n e .  In  m a n y  p l a c e s ,   immigrant and migrant workers face not only the  social stresses of being different but also a lack of  benefits, particularly health benefits, and a differ- ential in paid vacation time. Ideally, more univer- sal worker benefits would prevail. Gender and age differentials vary among cul- tures, and gender gaps in income and promotions  exist within our own society. Retirement in some  cultures is encouraged while in other cultures  expertise of elders is valued. Change is a constant influence on mental  health. Effects of change are a major source of  anxiety. Loss of control as well as fears of miscom- munication and inadequate job performance may  also threaten good mental health for workers fac- ing mega-mergers, downsizings, job transfers and  demands for more work from fewer workers. Mas- tering and updating skills and adoption of more  globally applicable health and safety standards  may help prevent some predictable effects on men- tal health. It is in the economic interest of employers and  their communities to acknowledge the relationship  among workers’ mental health, quality control,  productivity, profits and safety, on and off the job. Government, labor and industry can work  together to encourage communities to focus on  environmental factors, including commuting time,  personal space, air and noise pollution and reduc- tion of cigarette smoking, to reduce the unhealthy  effects from these sources. Health promotion  through employee and community wellness pro- grams with concern for ergonomics and human  factors can promote better mental health. Outside the workplace, many other factors can  affect people’s mental health. Threats of terror- ism continue to cause anxieties. While necessary  and costly for communities and workplaces, visibly  enhanced security measures and programs can help  reduce fears, although they may also increase fears.  Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is now a term  in our vocabulary because of terrorism and war.  Since September 11, 2001, when terrorist attacks  resulted in the deaths of more than 3,000 people in  New York City, Washington. D.C., and Pennsylvania,  millions of Americans have experienced depression,  anxiety and PTSD. Many rescue workers also expe- rienced these symptoms.

According to Jeff Zwiefel, M.S.,  Director, The National Exercise for Life Institute,  physical strength and stamina and a confident atti- tude are the main by-products of exercise. A study  at Baruch College, New York, found that people  who are stronger and more muscularly fit have a  significantly better self-image than their peers. Psy- chological tests have discovered that those who  exercise are more confident, emotionally stable and  outgoing than those who are sedentary. Joan C. Gondola, associate professor of physical  education at Baruch College, found the same posi- tive results of exercise on creativity levels when she  administered a test on female college students. One  group had exercised 20 minutes before the tests  and the other group had not; the exercise group  had more imaginative responses than those that  had not. The boost in creativity may be attributed to the  release of adrenaline and endorphins during exer- cise. The right side of the brain is stimulated by  these chemicals, which control creative and intui- tive processes. Exercise is an excellent way to relieve stress,  whether caused by pressures at work, family ten- sions or grief. However, exercise may also become  a compulsion, when the individual drops other  responsibilities in favor of improving body image or  losing weight. Because of our society’s emphasis on  a thin, slender body shape, many individuals have  become exercise addicts. For some individuals, such  addiction interferes with their mental well-being.  An example is compulsive exercise that accompa- nies eating disorders.

The therapy is based on humanistic  approaches that focus on helping family members  learn to use symptoms and anxieties constructively.  It is also known as symbolic- experiential family  therapy. See also PSYCHOTHERAPIES. exposure therapy  Behavioral therapies that  emphasize changing an individual’s responses to  phobic situations while gradually increasing expo- sure to the feared situation. Exposure therapy may  be effective for some phobias and for agoraphobia;  to be effective, appropriate drug therapy is also  used in many cases.

The system consists  of nerve pathways linking nerve nuclei in the sur- face of the cerebrum (the main mass of the brain),  the basal ganglia deep within the brain and parts of  the brain stem. Degeneration of or damage to parts  of the system can cause disturbances in execution  of voluntary (willful) movements and in muscle  tone and can cause the appearance of involuntary  (unwanted) movements such as tremors or writh- ing motions. Disturbances of this type occur in  Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and some  types of cerebral palsy. Extrapyramidal side effects can also occur as a  result of taking some phenothiazine drugs, used for  treating some mental disorders.
